    <h2>
      SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE. (1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (Edinburgh Review, October, 1838.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Courtenay <span
      class="pagenum">1</span><a name="link1" id="link1"></a>has long been well
      known to politicians as an industrious and useful official man, and as an
      upright and consistent member of Parliament. He has been one of the most
      moderate, and, at the same time, one of the least pliant members of the
      Conservative party. His conduct has, indeed, on some questions, been so
      Whiggish, that both those who applauded and those who condemned it have
      questioned his claim to be considered as a Tory. But his Toryism, such as
      it is, he has held fast through all changes of fortune and fashion; and he
      has at last retired from public life, leaving behind him, to the best of
      our belief, no personal enemy, and carrying with him the respect and good
      will of many who strongly dissent from his opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book, the fruit of Mr. Courtenay&rsquo;s leisure, is introduced by a
      preface in which he informs us that the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>Memoirs of the Life, Works, and Correspondence of Sir
     William Temple</i>. By the Right Hon. Thomas Peregrine
     Courtenay. 2 vols. 6vo. London: 1836.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">2</span><a name="link2" id="link2"></a>assistance
      furnished to him from various quarters &ldquo;has taught him the superiority of
      literature to politics for developing the kindlier feelings, and conducing
      to an agreeable life.&rdquo; We are truly glad that Mr. Courtenay is so well
      satisfied with his new employment, and we heartily congratulate him on
      having been driven by events to make an exchange which, advantageous as it
      is, few people make while they can avoid it. He has little reason, in our
      opinion, to envy any of those who are still engaged in a pursuit from
      which, at most, they can only expect that, by relinquishing liberal
      studies and social pleasures, by passing nights without sleep and summers
      without one glimpse of the beauty of nature, they may attain that
      laborious, that invidious, that closely watched slavery which is mocked
      with the name of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volumes before us are fairly entitled to the praise of diligence,
      care, good sense, and impartiality; and these qualities are sufficient to
      make a hook valuable, but not quite sufficient to make it readable. Mr.
      Courtenay has not sufficiently studied the arts of selection and
      compression. The information with which he furnishes us, must still, we
      apprehend, be considered as so much raw material. To manufacturers it will
      be highly useful; but it is not yet in such a form that it can be enjoyed
      by the idle consumer. To drop metaphor, we are afraid that this work will
      be less acceptable to those who read for the sake of reading, than to
      those who read in order to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot help adding, though we are extremely unwilling to quarrel with
      Mr. Courtenay about politics, that the book would not be at all the worse
      if it contained fewer snarls against the Whigs of the present day. Not
      only are these passages out of place in a <span class="pagenum">3</span><a
      name="link3" id="link3"></a>historical work, but some of them are
      intrinsically such that they would become the editor of a third-rate party
      newspaper better than a gentleman of Mr. Courtenay&rsquo;s talents and
      knowledge. For example, we are told that, &ldquo;it is a remarkable
      circumstance, familiar to those who are acquainted with history, but
      suppressed by the new Whigs, that the liberal politicians of the
      seventeenth century and the greater part of the eighteenth, never extended
      their liberality to the native Irish, or the professors of the ancient
      religion.&rdquo; What schoolboy of fourteen is ignorant of this remarkable
      circumstance? What Whig, new or old, was ever such an idiot as to think
      that it could be suppressed? Really we might as well say that it is a
      remarkable circumstance, familiar to people well read in history, but
      carefully suppressed by the Clergy of the Established Church, that in the
      fifteenth century England was in communion with Rome. We are tempted to
      make some remarks on another passage, which seems to be the peroration of
      a speech intended to have been spoken against the Reform Bill: but we
      forbear.
    </p>
    <p>
      We doubt whether it will be found that the memory of Sir William Temple
      owes much to Mr. Courtenay&rsquo;s researches. Temple is one of those men whom
      the world has agreed to praise highly without knowing much about them, and
      who are therefore more likely to lose than to gain by a close examination.
      Yet he is not without fair pretensions to the most honourable place among
      the statesmen of his time. A few of them equalled or surpassed him in
      talents; but they were men of no good repute for honesty. A few may be
      named whose patriotism was purer, nobler, and more disinterested than his;
      but they were men of no eminent ability. Morally, he was above
      Shaftesbury; intellectually, he was above Russell. <span class="pagenum">4</span><a
      name="link4" id="link4"></a>To say of a man that lie occupied a high
      position in times of misgovernment, of corruption, of civil and religious
      faction, that nevertheless he contracted no great stain and bore no part
      in any great crime, that he won the esteem of a profligate Court and of a
      turbulent people, without being guilty of any disgraceful subserviency to
      either, seems to be very high praise; and all this may with truth be said
      of Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Temple is not a man to our taste. A temper not naturally good, but
      under strict command; a constant regard to decorum; a rare caution in
      playing that mixed game of skill and-hazard, human life; a disposition to
      be content with small and certain winnings rather than to go on doubling
      the stake; these seem to us to be the most remarkable features of his
      character. This sort of moderation, when united, as in him it was, with
      very considerable abilities, is, under ordinary circumstances, scarcely to
      be distinguished from the highest and purest integrity, and yet may be
      perfectly compatible with laxity of principle, with coldness of heart, and
      with the most intense selfishness. Temple, we fear, had not sufficient
      warmth and elevation of sentiment to deserve the name of a virtuous man.
      He did not betray or oppress his country: nay, he rendered considerable
      services to her; but he risked nothing for her. No temptation which either
      the King or the Opposition could hold out ever induced him to come forward
      as the supporter either of arbitrary or of factious measures. But he was
      most careful not to give offence by strenuously opposing such measures. He
      never put himself prominently before the public eye, except at
      conjunctures when he was almost certain to gain and could not possibly
      lose, at conjunctures when the <span class="pagenum">5</span><a
      name="link5" id="link5"></a>interest of the State, the views of the Court,
      and the passions of the multitude, all appeared for an instant to
      coincide. By judiciously availing himself of several of these rare
      moments, he succeeded in establishing a high character for wisdom and
      patriotism. When the favourable crisis was passed, he never risked the
      reputation which he had won. He avoided the great offices of State with a
      caution almost pusillanimous, and confined himself to quiet and secluded
      departments of public business, in which he could enjoy moderate but
      certain advantages without incurring envy. If the circumstances of the
      country became such that it was impossible to take any part in politics
      without some danger, he retired to his library and his orchard, and, while
      the nation groaned under oppression, or resounded with tumult and with the
      din of civil arms, amused himself by writing memoirs and tying up
      apricots. His political career bore some resemblance to the military
      career of Lewis the Fourteenth. Lewis, lest his royal dignity should be
      compromised by failure, never repaired to a siege, till it had been
      reported to him by the most skilful officers in his service&rsquo;, that nothing
      could prevent the fall of the place. When this was ascertained, the
      monarch, in his helmet and cuirass, appeared among the tents, held
      councils of war, dictated the capitulation, received the keys, and then
      returned to Versailles to hear his flatterers repeat that Turenne had been
      beaten at Mariendal, that Condé had been forced to raise the siege of
      Arras, and that the only warrior whose glory had never been obscured by a
      single check was Lewis the Great. Yet Coudé and Turenne will always be
      considered as captains of a very different order from the invincible
      Lewis; and we must own that many statesmen who have committed <span
      class="pagenum">6</span><a name="link6" id="link6"></a>great faults,
      appear to us to be deserving of more esteem than the faultless Temple. For
      in truth his faultlessness is chiefly to be ascribed to his extreme dread
      of all responsibility, to his determination rather to leave his country in
      a scrape than to run any chance of being in a scrape himself. He seems to
      have been averse from danger; and it must be admitted that the dangers to
      which a public man was exposed, in those days of conflicting tyranny and
      sedition, were of the most serious kind. He could not bear discomfort,
      bodily or mental. His lamentations when, in the course of his diplomatic
      journeys, he was put a little out of his way, and forced, in the vulgar
      phrase, to rough it, are quite amusing. He talks of riding a day or two on
      a bad Westphalian road, of sleeping on straw for one night, of travelling
      in winter when the snow lay on the ground, as if he had gone on an
      expedition to the North Pole or to the source of the Nile. This kind of
      valetudinarian effeminacy, this habit of coddling himself, appears in all
      parts of his conduct. He loved fame, but not with the love of an exalted
      and generous mind. He loved it as an end, not at all as a means; as a
      personal luxury, not at all as an instrument of advantage to others. He
      scraped it together and treasured it up with a timid and niggardly thrift;
      and never employed the hoard in any enterprise, however virtuous and
      useful, in which there was hazard of losing one particle. No wonder if
      such a person did little, or nothing which deserves positive blame. But
      much more than this may justly be demanded of a man possessed of such
      abilities, and placed in such a situation. Had Temple been brought before
      Dante&rsquo;s infernal tribunal, he would not have been condemned to the deeper
      recesses of the abyss. He would not have <span class="pagenum">7</span><a
      name="link7" id="link7"></a>been boiled with Dundee in the crimson pool of
      Bulicame, or hurled with Danby into the seething pitch of Malebolge, or
      congealed with Churchill in the eternal ice of Giudecca; but he would
      perhaps have been placed in the dark vestibule next to the shade of that
      inglorious pontiff&mdash; <br /><br /><span class="indent25">&ldquo;Che fece per
      viltate il gran rifiuto.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course a man is not bound to be a politician any more than he is bound
      to be a soldier; and there are perfectly honourable ways of quitting both
      politics and the military profession. But neither in the one way of life,
      nor in the other, is any man entitled to take all the sweet and leave all
      the sour. A man who belongs to the army only in time of peace, who appears
      at reviews in Hyde Park, escorts the Sovereign with the utmost valour and
      fidelity to and from the House of Lords, and retires as soon as he thinks
      it likely that he may be ordered on an expedition, is justly thought to
      have disgraced himself. Some portion of the censure due to such a
      holiday-soldier may justly fall on the mere holiday-politician, who
      flinches from his duties as soon as those duties become difficult and
      disagreeable, that is to say, as soon as it becomes peculiarly important
      that he should resolutely perform them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though we are far indeed from considering Temple as a perfect
      statesman, though we place him below many statesmen who have committed
      very great errors, we cannot deny that, when compared with his
      contemporaries, he makes a highly respectable appearance. The reaction
      which followed the victory of the popular party over Charles the First,
      had produced a hurtful effect on the national character; and this effect
      was most discernible in the classes and in the places <span class="pagenum">8</span><a
      name="link8" id="link8"></a>which had been most strongly excited by the
      recent revolution. The deterioration was greater in London than in the
      country, and was greatest of all in the courtly and official circles.
      Almost all that remained of what had been good and noble in the Cavaliers
      and Roundheads of 1642, was now to be found in the middling orders. The
      principles and feelings which prompted the Grand Remonstrance were still
      strong among the sturdy yeomen, and the decent God-fearing merchants. The
      spirit of Derby and Capel still glowed in many sequestered manor-houses;
      but among those political leaders who, at the time of the Restoration,
      were still young or in the vigour of manhood, there was neither a
      Southampton nor a Vane, neither a Falkland nor a Hampden. The pure,
      fervent, and constant loyalty which, in the preceding reign, had remained
      unshaken on fields of disastrous battle, in foreign garrets and cellars,
      and at the bar of the High Court of Justice, was scarcely to be found
      among the rising courtiers. As little, or still less, could the new chiefs
      of parties lay claim to the great qualities of the statesmen who had stood
      at the head of the Long Parliament. Hampden, Pym, Vane, Cromwell, are
      discriminated from the ablest politicians of the succeeding generation, by
      all the strong lineaments which distinguish the men who produce
      revolutions from the men whom revolutions produce. The leader in a great
      change, the man who stirs up a reposing community, and overthrows a
      deeply-rooted system, may be a very depraved man; but he can scarcely be
      destitute of some moral qualities which extort even from enemies a
      reluctant admiration, fixedness of purpose, intensity of will, enthusiasm,
      which is not the less fierce or persevering because it is sometimes
      disguised under the <span class="pagenum">9</span><a name="link9"
       id="link9"></a>semblance of composure, and which bears down before it the
      force of circumstances and the opposition of reluctant minds. These
      qualities, variously combined with all sorts of virtues and vices, may be
      found, we think, in most of the authors of great civil and religious
      movements, in Cæsar, in Mahomet, in Hildebrand, in Dominic, in Luther, in
      Robespierre; and these qualities were found, in no scanty measure, among
      the chiefs of the party which opposed Charles the First. The character of
      the men whose minds are formed in the midst of the confusion which follows
      a great revolution is generally very different. Heat, the natural
      philosophers tell us, produces rarefaction of the air; and rarefaction of
      the air produces cold. So zeal makes revolutions; and revolutions make men
      zealous for nothing. The politicians of whom we speak, whatever may be
      their natural capacity or courage, are almost always characterised by a
      peculiar levity, a peculiar inconstancy, an easy, apathetic way of looking
      at the most solemn questions, a willingness to leave the direction of
      their course to fortune and popular opinion, a notion that one public
      cause is nearly as good as another, and a firm conviction that it is much
      better to be the hireling of the worst cause than to be a martyr to the
      best.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was most strikingly the case with the English statesmen of the
      generation which followed the Restoration. They had neither the enthusiasm
      of the Cavalier nor the enthusiasm of the Republican. They had been early
      emancipated from the dominion of old usages and feelings; yet they had not
      acquired a strong passion for innovation. Accustomed to see old
      establishments shaking, falling, lying in ruins all around them,
      accustomed to live under a succession of <span class="pagenum">10</span><a
      name="link10" id="link10"></a>constitutions of which the average duration
      was about a twelvemonth, they had no religious reverence for prescription,
      nothing of that frame of mind which naturally springs from the habitual
      contemplation of immemorial antiquity and immovable stability. Accustomed,
      on the other hand, to see change after change welcomed with eager hope and
      ending in disappointment, to see shame and confusion of face follow the
      extravagant hopes and predictions of rash and fanatical innovators, they
      had learned to look on professions of public spirit, and on schemes of
      reform, with distrust and contempt. They sometimes talked the language of
      devoted subjects, sometimes that of ardent lovers of their country. But
      their secret creed seems to have been, that loyalty was one great
      delusion, and patriotism another. If they really entertained any
      predilection for the monarchical or for the popular part of the
      constitution, for episcopacy or for presbyterianism, that predilection was
      feeble and languid, and instead of overcoming, as in the times of their
      fathers, the dread of exile, confiscation, and death, was rarely of power
      to resist the slightest impulse of selfish ambition or of selfish fear.
      Such was the texture of the presbyterianism of Lauderdale, and of the
      speculative republicanism of Halifax. The sense of political honour seemed
      to be extinct. With the great mass of mankind, the test of integrity in a
      public man is consistency. This test, though very defective, is perhaps
      the best that any, except very acute or very near observers, are capable
      of applying; and does undoubtedly enable the people to form an estimate of
      the characters of the great, which, on the whole, approximates to
      correctness. But during the Latter part of the seventeenth century,
      inconsistency <span class="pagenum">11</span><a name="link11" id="link11"></a>had
      necessarily ceased to be a disgrace; and a man was no more taunted with
      it, than he is taunted with being black at Timbuctoo. Nobody was ashamed
      of avowing what was common between him and the whole nation. In the short
      space of about seven years, the supreme power had been held by the Long
      Parliament, by a Council of Officers, by Barebones&rsquo; Parliament, by a
      Council of Officers again, by a Protector according to the Instrument of
      Government, by a Protector according to the Humble Petition and Advice, by
      the Long Parliament again, by a third Council of Officers, by the Long
      Parliament a third time, by the Convention, and by the King. In such
      times, consistency is so inconvenient to a man who affects it, and to all
      who are connected with him, that it ceases to be regarded as a virtue, and
      is considered as impracticable obstinacy and idle scrupulosity. Indeed, in
      such times, a good citizen may be bound in duty to serve a succession of
      Governments. Blake did so in one profession and Hale in another; and the
      conduct of both has been approved by posterity. But it is clear that when
      inconsistency with respect to the most important public questions has
      ceased to be a reproach, inconsistency with respect to questions of minor
      importance is not likely to be regarded as dishonourable. In a country in
      which many very honest people had, within the space of a few months,
      supported the government of the Protector, that of the Rump, and that of
      the King, a man was not likely to be ashamed of abandoning his party for a
      place, or of voting for a bill which he had opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public men of the times which followed the Restoration were by no
      means deficient in courage or ability; and some kinds of talent appear to
      have been developed <span class="pagenum">12</span><a name="link12"
       id="link12"></a>amongst them to a remarkable, we might almost say, to a
      morbid and unnatural degree. Neither Theramenes in ancient, nor Talleyrand
      in modern times, had a finer perception of all the peculiarities of
      character, and of all the indications of coming change, than some of our
      countrymen in that age. Their power of reading things of high import, in
      signs which to others were invisible or unintelligible, resembled magic.
      But the curse of Reuben was upon them all: &ldquo;Unstable as water, thou shalt
      not excel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This character is susceptible of innumerable modifications, according to
      the innumerable varieties of intellect and temper in which it may be
      found. Men of unquiet minds and violent ambition followed a fearfully
      eccentric course, darted wildly from one extreme to another, served and
      betrayed all parties in turn, showed their unblushing foreheads
      alternately in the van of the most corrupt administrations and of the most
      factious oppositions, were privy to the most guilty mysteries, first of
      the Cabal, and then of the Rye-House Plot, abjured their religion to win
      their sovereign&rsquo;s favour while they were secretly planning his overthrow,
      shrived themselves to Jesuits with letters in cipher from the Prince of
      Orange in their pockets, corresponded with the Hague whilst in office
      under James, and began to correspond with St. Germain&rsquo;s as soon as they
      had kissed hands for office under William. But Temple was not one of
      these. He was not destitute of ambition. But his was not one of those
      souls in which unsatisfied ambition anticipates the tortures of hell,
      gnaws like the worm which dieth not, and burns like the fire which is not
      quenched. His principle was to make sure of safety and comfort, and to let
      greatness come if it would. It came: he enjoyed it: and, in the very <span
      class="pagenum">13</span><a name="link13" id="link13"></a>first moment in
      which it could no longer be enjoyed without danger and vexation, he
      contentedly let it go. He was not exempt, we think, from the prevailing
      political immorality. His mind took the contagion, but took it <i>ad modum
      recipientis</i>, in a form so mild that an undiscerning judge might doubt
      whether it were indeed the same fierce pestilence that was raging all
      around. The malady partook of the constitutional languor of the patient.
      The general corruption, mitigated by his calm and unadventurous
      temperament, showed itself in omissions and desertions, not in positive
      crimes; and his inactivity, though sometimes timorous and selfish, becomes
      respectable when compared with the malevolent and perfidious restlessness
      of Shaftesbury and Sunderland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, sprang from a family which, though ancient and honourable, had,
      before his time, been scarcely mentioned in our history, but which, long
      after his death, produced so many eminent men, and formed such
      distinguished alliances, that it exercised, in a regular and
      constitutional manner, an influence in the state scarcely inferior to that
      which, in widely different times, and by widely different arts, the House
      of Neville attained in England, and that of Douglas in Scotland. During
      the latter years of George the Second, and through the whole reign of
      George the Third, members of that widely spread and powerful connection
      were almost constantly at the head either of the Government or of the
      Opposition. There were times when the cousinhood, as it was once
      nicknamed, would of itself have furnished almost all the materials
      necessary for the construction of an efficient Cabinet. Within the space
      of fifty years, three First Lords of the Treasury, three Secretaries of
      State, two Keepers <span class="pagenum">14</span><a name="link14"
       id="link14"></a>of the Privy Seal, and four First Lords of the Admiralty
      were appointed from among the sons and grandsons of the Countess Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      So splendid have been the fortunes of the main stock of the Temple family,
      continued by female succession. William Temple, the first of the line who
      attained to any historical eminence, was of a younger branch. His father,
      Sir John Temple, was Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and distinguished
      himself among the Privy Councillors of that kingdom by the zeal with
      which, at the commencement of the struggle between the Crown and the Long
      Parliament, he supported the popular cause. He was arrested by order of
      the Duke of Ormond, but regained his liberty by an exchange, repaired to
      England, and there sate in the House of Commons as burgess for Chichester.
      He attached himself to the Presbyterian party, and was one of those
      moderate members who, at the close of the year 1648, voted for treating
      with Charles on the basis to which that Prince had himself agreed, and who
      were, in consequence, turned out of the House, with small ceremony, by
      Colonel Pride. Sir John seems, however, to have made his peace with the
      victorious Independents; for, in 1653, he resumed his office in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Temple was married to a sister of the celebrated Henry Hammond, a
      learned and pious divine, who took the side of the King with very
      conspicuous zeal during the civil war, and was deprived of his preferment
      in the church after the victory of the Parliament. On account of the loss
      which Hammond sustained on this occasion, he has the honour of being
      designated, in the cant of that new brood of Oxonian sectaries who unite
      the worst parts of the Jesuit to the worst parts of the Orangeman, as
      Hammond, Presbyter, Doctor, and Confessor. <span class="pagenum">15</span><a
      name="link15" id="link15"></a>William Temple, Sir John&rsquo;s eldest son, was
      born in London in the year 1628. He received his early education under his
      maternal uncle, was subsequently sent to school at Bishop-Stortford, and,
      at seventeen, began to reside at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where the
      celebrated Cudworth was his tutor. The times were not favourable to study.
      The Civil War disturbed even the quiet cloisters and bowling-greens of
      Cambridge, produced violent revolutions in the government and discipline
      of the colleges, and unsettled the minds of the students. Temple forgot at
      Emmanuel all the little Greek which he had brought from Bishop-Stortford,
      and never retrieved the loss; a circumstance which would hardly be worth
      noticing but for the almost incredible fact that, fifty years later, he
      was so absurd as to set up his own authority against that of Bentley on
      questions of Greek history and philology. He made no proficiency either in
      the old philosophy which still lingered in the schools of Cambridge, or in
      the new philosophy of which Lord Bacon was the founder. But to the end of
      his life he continued to speak of the former with ignorant admiration, and
      of the latter with equally ignorant contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      After residing at Cambridge two years, he departed without taking a
      degree, and set out upon his travels. He seems to have been then a lively,
      agreeable young man of fashion, not by any means deeply read, but versed
      in all the superficial accomplishments of a gentleman, and acceptable in
      all polite societies. In politics he professed himself a Royalist. His
      opinions on religious subjects seem to have been such as might be expected
      from a young man of quick parts, who had received a rambling education,
      who had not thought, deeply, who had been disgusted by the morose
      austerity <span class="pagenum">16</span><a name="link16" id="link16"></a>of
      the Puritans, and who, surrounded from childhood by the hubbub of
      conflicting sects, might easily learn to feel an impartial contempt for
      them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his road to France he fell in with the son and daughter of Sir Peter
      Osborne. Sir Peter held Guernsey for the King, and the young people were,
      like their father, warm for the royal cause. At an inn where they stopped
      in the Isle of Wight, the brother amused himself with inscribing on the
      windows his opinion of the ruling powers. For this instance of malignancy
      the whole party were arrested, and brought before the governor. The
      sister, trusting to the tenderness which, even in those troubled times,
      scarcely any gentleman of any party ever failed to show where a woman was
      concerned, took the crime on herself, and was immediately set at liberty
      with her fellow-travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident, as was natural, made a deep impression on Temple. He was
      only twenty. Dorothy Osborne was twenty-one. She is said to have been
      handsome; and there remains abundant proof that she possessed an ample
      share of the dexterity, the vivacity, and the tenderness of her sex.
      Temple soon became, in the phrase of that time, her servant, and she
      returned his regard. But difficulties, as great as ever expanded a novel
      to the fifth volume, opposed their wishes. When the courtship commenced,
      the father of the hero was sitting in the Long Parliament; the father of
      the heroine was commanding in Guernsey for King Charles. Even when the war
      ended, and Sir Peter Osborne returned to his seat at Chicksands, the
      prospects of the lovers were scarcely less gloomy. Sir John Temple had a
      more advantageous alliance in view for his son. Dorothy Osborne was in the
      mean <span class="pagenum">17</span><a name="link17" id="link17"></a>time
      besieged by as many suitors as were drawn to Belmont by the fame of
      Portia. The most distinguished on the list was Henry Cromwell. Destitute
      of the capacity, the energy, the magnanimity of his illustrious father,
      destitute also of the meek and placid virtues of his elder brother, this
      young man was perhaps a more formidable rival in love than either of them
      would have been. Mrs. Hutchinson, speaking the sentiments of the grave and
      aged, describes him as an &ldquo;insolent foole,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;debauched ungodly
      cavalier.&rdquo; These expressions probably mean that he was one who, among
      young and dissipated people, would pass for a fine gentleman. Dorothy was
      fond of dogs of larger and more formidable breed than those which lie on
      modern hearth rugs; and Henry Cromwell promised that the highest
      functionaries at Dublin should be set to work to procure her a fine Irish
      greyhound. She seems to have felt his attentions as very flattering,
      though his father was then only Lord-General, and not yet Protector. Love,
      however, triumphed over ambition, and the young lady appears never to have
      regretted her decision; though, in a letter written just at the time when
      all England was ringing with the news of the violent dissolution of the
      Long Parliament, she could not refrain from reminding Temple, with
      pardonable vanity, &ldquo;how great she might have been, if she had been so wise
      as to have taken hold of the offer of H. C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it only the influence of rivals that Temple had to dread. The
      relations of his mistress regarded him with personal dislike, and spoke of
      him as an unprincipled adventurer, without honour or religion, ready to
      render service to any party for the sake of preferment. This is, indeed, a
      very distorted view of Temple&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">18</span><a
      name="link18" id="link18"></a>character. Yet a character, even in the most
      distorted view taken of it by the most angry and prejudiced minds,
      generally retains something of its outline. No caricaturist ever
      represented Mr. Pitt as a Falstaff, or Mr. Fox as a skeleton; nor did any
      libeller ever impute parsimony to Sheridan, or profusion to Marlborough.
      It must be allowed that the turn of mind which the eulogists of Temple
      have dignified with the appellation of philosophical indifference, and
      which, however becoming it may be in an old and experienced statesman, has
      a somewhat ungraceful appearance in youth, might easily appear shocking to
      a family who were ready to fight or to suffer martyrdom for their exiled
      King and their persecuted church. The poor girl was exceedingly hurt and
      irritated by these imputations on her lover, defended him warmly behind
      his back, and addressed to himself some very tender and anxious
      admonitions, mingled with assurances of her confidence in his honour and
      virtue. On one occasion she was most highly provoked by the way in which
      one of her brothers spoke of Temple. &ldquo;We talked ourselves weary,&rdquo; she
      says; &ldquo;he renounced me, and I defied him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Near seven years did this arduous wooing continue. We are not accurately
      informed respecting Temple&rsquo;s movements during that time. But he seems to
      have led a rambling life, sometimes on the Continent, sometimes in
      Ireland, sometimes in London. He made himself master of the French and
      Spanish languages, and amused himself by writing essays and romances, an
      employment which at least served the purpose of forming his style. The
      specimen which Mr. Courtenay has preserved of these early compositions is
      by no means contemptible: indeed, there is one passage on <span
      class="pagenum">19</span><a name="link19" id="link19"></a>Like and Dislike
      which could have been produced only by a mind habituated carefully to
      reflect on its own operations, and which reminds us of the best things in
      Montaigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple appears to have kept up a very active correspondence with his
      mistress. His letters are lost, but hers have been preserved; and many of
      them appear in these volumes. Mr. Courtenay expresses some doubt whether
      his readers will think him justified in inserting so large a number of
      these epistles. We only wish that there were twice as many. Very little
      indeed of the diplomatic correspondence of that generation is so well
      worth reading. There is a vile phrase of which bad historians are
      exceedingly fond, &ldquo;the dignity of history.&rdquo; One writer is in possession of
      some anecdotes which would illustrate most strikingly the operation of the
      Mississippi scheme on the manners and morals of the Parisians. But he
      suppresses those anecdotes, because they are too low for the dignity of
      history. Another is strongly tempted to mention some facts indicating the
      horrible state of the prisons of England two hundred years age. But he
      hardly thinks that the sufferings of a dozen felons, pigging together on
      bare bricks in a hole fifteen feet square, would form a subject suited to
      the dignity of history. Another, from respect for the dignity of history,
      publishes an account of the reign of George the Second, without ever
      mentioning Whitefield&rsquo;s preaching in Moorfields. How should a writer, who
      can talk about senates, and congresses of sovereigns, and pragmatic
      sanctions, and ravelines, and counterscarps, and battles where ten
      thousand men are killed, and six thousand men with fifty stand of colours
      and eighty guns taken, stoop to the Stock-Exchange, to Newgate, to the
      theatre, to the tabernacle? <span class="pagenum">20</span><a name="link20"
       id="link20"></a>Tragedy has its dignity as well as history; and how much
      the tragic art has owed to that dignity any man may judge who will compare
      the majestic Alexandrines in which the Seigneur Oreste and Madame
      Andromaque utter their complaints, with the chattering of the fool in Lear
      and of the nurse in Romeo and Juliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a historian should not record trifles, that he should confine himself
      to what is important, is perfectly true. But many writers seem never to
      have considered on what the historical importance of an event depends.
      They seem not to be aware that the importance of a fact, when that fact is
      considered with reference to its immediate effects, and the importance of
      the same fact, when that fact is considered as part of the materials for
      the construction of a science, are two very different things. The quantity
      of good or evil which a transaction produces is by no means necessarily
      proportioned to the quantity of light which that transaction affords, as
      to the way in which good or evil may hereafter be produced. The poisoning
      of an emperor is in one sense a far more serious matter than the poisoning
      of a rat. But the poisoning of a rat may be an era in chemistry; and an
      emperor may be poisoned by such ordinary means, and with such ordinary
      symptoms, that no scientific journal would notice the occurrence. An
      action for a hundred thousand pounds is in one sense a more momentous
      affair than an action for fifty-pounds. But it by no means follows that
      the learned gentlemen who report the proceedings of the courts of law
      ought to give a fuller account of an action for a hundred thousand pounds,
      than of an action for fifty pounds. For a cause in which a large sum is at
      stake may be important only to the particular <span class="pagenum">21</span><a
      name="link21" id="link21"></a>plaintiff and the particular defendant. A
      cause, on the other hand, in which a small sum is at stake, may establish
      some great principle interesting to half the families in the kingdom. The
      case is exactly the same with that class of subjects of which historians
      treat. To an Athenian, in the time of the Peloponnesian war, the result of
      the battle of Delium was far more important than the fate of the comedy of
      The Knights. But to us the fact that the comedy of The Knights was brought
      on the Athenian stage with success is far more important than the fact
      that the Athenian phalanx gave way to Delium. Neither the one event nor
      the other has now any intrinsic importance. We are in no danger of being
      speared by the Thebans. We are not quizzed in The Knights. To us the
      importance of both events consists in the value of the general truth which
      is to be learned from them. What general truth do we learn from the
      accounts which have come down to us of the battle of Delium? Very little
      more than this, that when two armies fight, its not improbable that one of
      them will be very soundly beaten, a truth which it would not, we
      apprehend, be difficult to establish, even if all memory of the battle of
      Delium were lost among men. But a man who becomes acquainted with the
      comedy of The Knights, and with the history of that comedy, at once feels
      his mind enlarged. Society is presented to him under a new aspect. He may
      have read and travelled much. He may have visited all the countries of
      Europe, and the civilised nations of the East. He may have observed the
      manners of many barbarous races. But here is something altogether
      different from every thing which he has seen, either among polished men or
      among savages. Here is a community politically, intellectually, <span
      class="pagenum">22</span><a name="link22" id="link22"></a>and morally
      unlike any other community of which he has the means of forming an
      opinion. This is the really precious part of history, the corn which some
      threshers carefully sever from the chaff, for the purpose of gathering the
      chaff into the garner, and flinging the corn into the fire.

      Thinking thus, we are glad to learn so much, and would willingly learn
      more, about the loves of Sir William and his mistress. In the seventeenth
      century, to be sure, Lewis the Fourteenth was a much more important person
      than Temple&rsquo;s sweetheart. But death and time equalise all things. Neither
      the great King, nor the beauty of Bedfordshire, neither the gorgeous
      paradise of Marli nor Mistress Osborne&rsquo;s favourite walk &ldquo;in the common
      that lay hard by the house, where a great many young wenches used to keep
      sheep and cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads,&rdquo; is any thing to
      us. Lewis and Dorothy are alike dust. A cotton-mill stands on the rains of
      Marli; and the Osbornes have ceased to dwell under the ancient roof of
      Chicksands. But of that information for the sake of which alone it is
      worth while to study remote events, we find so much in the love letters
      which Mr. Courtenay has published, that we would gladly purchase equally
      interesting billets with ten times their weight in state-papers taken at
      random. To us surely it is as useful to know how the young ladies of
      England employed themselves a hundred and eighty years ago, how far their
      minds were cultivated, what were their favourite studies, what degree of
      liberty was allowed to them, what use they made of that liberty, what
      accomplishments they most valued, in men, and what proofs of tenderness
      delicacy permitted them to give to favoured suitors, as to know all about
      the <span class="pagenum">23</span><a name="link23" id="link23"></a>seizure
      of Franche Comté and the treaty of Nimeguen. The mutual relations of the
      two sexes seem to us to be at least as important as the mutual relations
      of any two governments in the world; and a series of letters written by a
      virtuous, amiable, and sensible girl, and intended for the eye of her
      lover alone, can scarcely fail to throw some light on the relations of the
      sexes; whereas it is perfectly possible, as all who have made any
      historical researches can attest, to read bale after bale of despatches
      and protocols, without catching one glimpse of light about the relations
      of governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Courtenay proclaims that he is one of Dorothy Osborne&rsquo;s devoted
      servants, and expresses a hope that the publication of her letters will
      add to the number. We must declare ourselves his rivals. She really seems
      to have been a very charming young woman, modest, generous, affectionate,
      intelligent, and sprightly; a royalist, as was to be expected from her
      connections, with-out any of that political asperity which is as unwomanly
      as a long beard; religious, and occasionally gliding into a very pretty
      and endearing sort of preaching, yet not too good to partake of such
      diversions as London afforded under the melancholy rule of the puritans,
      or to giggle a little at a ridiculous sermon from a divine who was thought
      to be one of the great lights of the Assembly at Westminster; with a
      little turn for coquetry, which was yet perfectly compatible with warm and
      disinterested attachment, and a little turn for satire, which yet seldom
      passed the bounds of good-nature. She loved reading; but her studies were
      not those of Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey. She read the verses of
      Cowley and Lord Broghill, French Memoirs recommended by her lover, and the
      travels of Fernando <span class="pagenum">24</span><a name="link24"
       id="link24"></a>Mendez Pinto. But her favourite books were those ponderous
      French romances which modern readers know chiefly from the pleasant satire
      of Charlotte Lennox. She could not, however, help laughing at the vile
      English into which they were translated. Her own style is very agreeable;
      nor are her letters at all the worse for some passages in which raillery
      and tenderness are mixed in a very engaging namby-pamby.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last the constancy of the lovers had triumphed over all the
      obstacles which kinsmen and rivals could oppose to their union, a yet more
      serious calamity befell them. Poor Mistress Osborne fell ill of the
      smallpox, and, though she escaped with life, lost all her beauty. To this
      most severe trial the affection and honour of the lovers of that age was
      not unfrequently subjected. Our readers probably remember what Mrs.
      Hutchinson tells us of herself. The lofty Cornelia-like spirit of the aged
      matron seems to melt into a long forgotten softness when she relates how
      her beloved Colonel &ldquo;married her as soon as she was able to quit the
      chamber, when the priest and all that saw her were affrighted to look on
      her. But God,&rdquo; she adds, with a not ungraceful vanity, &ldquo;recompensed his
      justice and constancy, by restoring her as well as before.&rdquo; Temple showed
      on this occasion the same justice and constancy which did so much honour
      to Colonel Hutchinson. The date of the marriage is not exactly known. But
      Mr. Courtenay supposes it to have taken place about the end of the year
      1654. From this time we lose sight of Dorothy, and are reduced to form our
      opinion of the terms on which she and her husband were from very slight
      indications which may easily mislead us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple soon went to Ireland, and resided with his father, partly at
      Dublin, partly in the county of Carlow. <span class="pagenum">25</span><a
      name="link25" id="link25"></a>Ireland was probably then a more agreeable
      residence for the higher classes, as compared with England, than it has
      ever been before or since. In no part of the empire were the superiority
      of Cromwell&rsquo;s abilities and the force of his character so signally
      displayed. He had not the power, and probably had not the inclination, to
      govern that island in the best way. The rebellion of the aboriginal race
      had excited in England a strong religious and national aversion to them:
      nor is there any reason to believe that the Protector was so far beyond
      his age as to be free from the prevailing sentiment. He had vanquished
      them; he knew that they were in his power; and he regarded them as a band
      of malefactors and idolaters, who were mercifully treated if they were not
      smitten with the edge of the sword. On those who resisted he had made war
      as the Hebrews made war on the Canaanites. Drogheda was as Jericho; and
      Wexford as Ai. To the remains of the old population the conqueror granted
      a peace, such as that which Israel granted to the Gibeonites. He made them
      hewers of wood and drawers of water. But, good or bad, he could not be
      otherwise than great. Under favourable circumstances, Ireland would have
      found in him a most just and beneficent ruler. She found in him a tyrant;
      not a small teasing tyrant, such as those who have so long been her curse
      and her shame, but one of those awful tyrants who, at long intervals, seem
      to be sent on earth, like avenging angels, with some high commission of
      destruction and renovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no man of half measures, of mean affronts and ungracious
      concessions. His Protestant ascendency was not an ascendency of ribands,
      and fiddles, and statues, and processions. He would never have dreamed of
      abolishing the penal code and withholding <span class="pagenum">26</span><a
      name="link26" id="link26"></a>from Catholics the elective franchise, of
      giving them the elective franchise and excluding them from Parliament, of
      admitting them to Parliament, and refusing to them a full and equal
      participation in all the blessings of society and government. The thing
      most alien from his clear intellect and his commanding spirit was petty
      persecution. He knew how to tolerate; and he knew how to destroy. His
      administration in Ireland was an administration on what are now called
      Orange principles, followed out most ably, most steadily, most
      undauntedly, most unrelentingly, to every extreme consequence to which
      those principles lead; and it would, if continued, inevitably have
      produced the effect which he contemplated, an entire decomposition and
      reconstruction of society. He had a great and definite object in view, to
      make Ireland thoroughly English, to make Ireland another Yorkshire or
      Norfolk. Thinly peopled as Ireland then was, this end was not
      unattainable; and there is every reason to believe that, if his policy had
      been followed during fifty years, this end would have been attained.
      Instead of an emigration, such as we now see from Ireland to England,
      there was, under his government, a constant and large emigration from
      England to Ireland. This tide of population ran almost as strongly as that
      which now runs from Massachusetts and Connecticut to the states behind the
      Ohio. The native race was driven back before the advancing van of the
      Anglo-Saxon population, as the American Indians or the tribes of Southern
      Africa are now driven back before the white settlers. Those fearful
      phænomena which have almost invariably attended the planting of civilised
      colonies in uncivilised countries, and which had been known to the nations
      of Europe only by distant and questionable rumour, were now publicly
      exhibited in <span class="pagenum">27</span><a name="link27" id="link27"></a>their
      sight. The words, &ldquo;extirpation,&rdquo; &ldquo;eradication,&rdquo; were often in the mouths
      of the English back-settlers of Leinster and Munster, cruel words, yet, in
      their cruelty, containing more mercy than much softer expressions which
      have since been sanctioned by universities and cheered by Parliaments. For
      it is in truth more merciful to extirpate a hundred thousand human beings
      at once, and to fill the void with a well-governed population, than to
      misgovern millions through a long succession of generations. We can much
      more easily pardon tremendous severities inflicted for a great object,
      than an endless series of paltry vexations and oppressions inflicted for
      no rational object at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland was fast becoming English. Civilisation and wealth were making
      rapid progress in almost every part of the island. The effects of that
      iron despotism are described to us by a hostile witness in very remarkable
      language. &ldquo;Which is more wonderful,&rdquo; says Lord Clarendon, &ldquo;all this was
      done and settled within little more than two years, to that degree of
      perfection that there were many buildings raised for beauty as well as
      use, orderly and regular plantations of trees, and fences and inclosures
      raised throughout the kingdom, purchases made by one from another at very
      valuable rates, and jointures made upon marriages, and all other
      conveyances and settlements executed, as in a kingdom at peace within
      itself, and where no doubt could be made of the validity of titles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Temple&rsquo;s feelings about Irish questions were those of a colonist and a
      member of the dominant caste. He troubled himself as little about the
      welfare of the remains of the old Celtic population, as an English farmer
      on the Swan River troubles himself about the New Hollanders, or a Dutch
      boor at the Cape about <span class="pagenum">28</span><a name="link28"
       id="link28"></a>the Caffres. The years which he passed in Ireland, while
      the Cromwellian system was in full operation, he always described as
      &ldquo;years of great satisfaction.&rdquo; Farming, gardening, county business, and
      studies rather entertaining than profound, occupied his time. In politics
      he took no part, and many years later he attributed this inaction to his
      love of the ancient constitution, which, he said, &ldquo;would not suffer him to
      enter into public affairs till the way was plain for the King&rsquo;s happy
      restoration.&rdquo; It does not appear, indeed, that any offer of employment was
      made to him. If he really did refuse any preferment, we may, without much
      breach of charity, attribute the refusal rather to the caution which,
      during his whole life, prevented him from running any risk, than to the
      fervour of his loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1660 he made his first appearance in public life. He sat in the
      convention which, in the midst of the general confusion that preceded the
      Restoration, was summoned by the chiefs of the army of Ireland to meet in
      Dublin. After the King&rsquo;s return an Irish parliament was regularly
      convoked, in which Temple represented the county of Carlow. The details of
      his conduct in this situation are not known to us. But we are told in
      general terms, and can easily believe, that he showed great moderation,
      and great aptitude for business. It is probable that he also distinguished
      himself in debate; for many years afterwards he remarked that &ldquo;his friends
      in Ireland used to think that, if he had any talent at all, it lay in that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In May, 1668, the Irish parliament was prorogued, and Temple repaired to
      England with his wife. His income amounted to about five hundred pounds a
      year, a sum which was then sufficient for the wants of a family mixing in
      fashionable circles. He passed two <span class="pagenum">29</span><a
      name="link29" id="link29"></a>years in London, where he seems to have led
      that easy, lounging life which was best suited to his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not, however, unmindful of his interest. He had brought with him
      letters of introduction from the Duke of Ormond, then Lord-Lieutenant of
      Ireland, to Clarendon, and to Henry Bennet, Lord Arlington, who was
      Secretary of State. Clarendon was at the head of affairs. But his power
      was visibly declining, and was certain to decline more and more every day.
      An observer much less discerning than Temple might easily perceive that
      the Chancellor was a man who belonged to a by-gone world, a representative
      of a past age, of obsolete modes of thinking, of unfashionable vices, and
      of more unfashionable virtues. His long exile had made him a stranger in&rsquo;
      the country of his birth. His mind, heated by conflict and by personal
      suffering, was far more set against popular and tolerant courses than it
      had been at the time of the breaking out of the civil war. He pined for
      the decorous tyranny of the old Whitehall; for the days of that sainted
      king who deprived his people of their money and their ears, but let their
      wives and daughters alone; and could scarcely reconcile himself to a court
      with a seraglio and without a Star-chamber. By taking this course he made
      himself every day more odious, both to the sovereign, who loved pleasure
      much more than prerogative, and to the people, who dreaded royal
      prerogatives much more than royal pleasures; and thus he was at last more
      detested by the Court than any chief of the Opposition, and more detested
      by the Parliament than any pandar of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, whose great maxim was to defend no party, was not likely to cling
      to the falling fortunes of a minister the study of whose life was to
      offend all <span class="pagenum">30</span><a name="link30" id="link30"></a>parties.
      Arlington, whose influence was gradually rising as that of Clarendon
      diminished, was the most useful patron to whom a young adventurer could
      attach himself. This statesman, without virtue, wisdom, or strength of
      mind, had raised himself to greatness by superficial qualities, and was
      the mere creature of the time, the circumstances, and the company. The
      dignified reserve of manners which he had acquired during a residence in
      Spain provoked the ridicule of those who considered the usages of the
      French court as the only standard of good breeding, but served to impress
      the crowd with a favourable opinion of his sagacity and gravity. In
      situations where the solemnity of the Escurial would have been out of
      place, he threw it aside without difficulty, and conversed with great
      humour and vivacity. While the multitude were talking of &ldquo;Bennet&rsquo;s grave
      looks,&rdquo; (1) his mirth made his presence always welcome in the royal
      closet. While Buckingham, in the antechamber, was mimicking the pompous
      Castilian strut of the Secretary, for the diversion of Mistress Stuart,
      this stately Don was ridiculing Clarendon&rsquo;s sober counsels to the King
      within, till his Majesty cried with laughter, and the Chancellor with
      vexation. There perhaps never was a man whose outward demeanour made such
      different impressions on different people. Count Hamilton, for example,
      describes him as a stupid formalist, who had been made secretary solely on
      account of his mysterious and important looks. Clarendon, on the other
      hand, represents him as a man whose &ldquo;best faculty was raillery,&rdquo; and who
      was &ldquo;for his pleasant and agreeable humour acceptable unto the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) &ldquo;Bennet&rsquo;s grave looks were a pretence&rdquo; is a line in one
     of the best political poems of that age.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="link31" id="link31"></a>The truth
      seems to be that, destitute as Bennet was of all the higher qualifications
      of a minister, he had a wonderful talent for becoming, in outward
      semblance, all things to all men. He had two aspects, a busy and serious
      one for the public, whom he wished to awe into respect, and a gay one for
      Charles, who thought that the greatest service which could be rendered to
      a prince was to amuse him. Yet both these were masks which he laid aside
      when they had served their turn. Long after, when he had retired to his
      deer park and fish-ponds in Suffolk, and had no motive to act the part
      either of the hidalgo or of the buffoon, Evelyn, who was neither an
      unpractised nor an undiscerning judge, conversed much with him, and
      pronounced him to be a man of singularly polished manners and of great
      colloquial powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarendon, proud and imperious by nature, soured by age and disease, and
      relying on his great talents and services, sought out no new allies. He
      seems to have taken a sort of morose pleasure in slighting and provoking
      all the rising talent of the kingdom. His connections were almost entirely
      confined to the small circle, every day becoming smaller, of old cavaliers
      who had been friends of his youth or companions of his exile. Arlington,
      on the other hand, beat up everywhere for recruits. No man had a greater
      personal following, and no man exerted himself more to serve his
      adherents. It was a kind of habit with him to push up his dependents to
      his own level, and then to complain bitterly of their ingratitude because
      they did not choose to be his dependents any longer. It was thus that he
      quarrelled with two successive Treasurers, Gifford and Danby. To Arlington
      Temple attached himself, and was not sparing of warm professions of <span
      class="pagenum">32</span><a name="link32" id="link32"></a>affection, or
      even, we grieve to say, of gross and almost profane adulation. In no long
      time he obtained his reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      England was in a very different situation with respect to foreign powers
      from that which she had occupied during the splendid administration of the
      Protector. She was engaged in war with the United Provinces, then governed
      with almost regal power by the Grand Pensionary, John de Witt; and though
      no war had ever cost the kingdom so much, none had ever been more feebly
      and meanly conducted. France had espoused the interests of the
      States-General. Denmark seemed likely to take the same side. Spain,
      indignant at the close political and matrimonial alliance which Charles
      had formed with the House of Braganza, was not disposed to lend him any
      assistance. The great plague of London had suspended trade, had scattered
      the ministers and nobles, had paralysed every department of the public
      service, and had increased the gloomy discontent which misgovernment had
      begun to excite throughout the nation. One continental ally England
      possessed, the Bishop of Munster, a restless and ambitious prelate, bred a
      soldier, and still a soldier in all his tastes and passions. He hated the
      Dutch for interfering in the affairs of his see, and declared himself
      willing to risk his little dominions for the chance of revenge. He sent,
      accordingly, a strange kind of ambassador to London, a Benedictine monk,
      who spoke bad English, and looked, says Lord Clarendon, &ldquo;like a carter.&rdquo;
       This person brought a letter from the Bishop, offering to make an attack
      by land on the Dutch territory. The English ministers eagerly caught at
      the proposal, and promised a subsidy of 500,000 rix-dollars to their new
      ally. It was determined to send an English <span class="pagenum">33</span><a
      name="link33" id="link33"></a>agent to Munster; and Arlington, to whose
      department the business belonged, fixed on Temple for this post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple accepted the commission, and acquitted himself to the satisfaction
      of his employers, though the whole plan ended in nothing, and the Bishop,
      finding that France had joined Holland, made haste, after pocketing an
      instalment of his subsidy, to conclude a separate peace. Temple, at a
      later period, looked back with no great satisfaction to this part of his
      life; and excused himself for undertaking a negotiation from which little
      good could result, by saying that he was then young and very new to
      business. In truth, he could hardly have been placed in a situation where
      the eminent diplomatic talents which he possessed could have appeared to
      less advantage. He was ignorant of the German language, and did not easily
      accommodate himself to the manners of the people. He could not bear much
      wine; and none but a hard drinker had any chance of success in Westphalian
      Society. Under all these disadvantages, however, he gave so much
      satisfaction that he was created a baronet, and appointed resident at the
      viceregal court of Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brussels suited Temple far better than the palaces of the boar-hunting and
      wine-bibbing princes of Germany. He now occupied one of the most important
      posts of observation in which a diplomatist could be stationed. He was
      placed in the territory of a great neutral power, between the territories
      of two great powers which were at war with England. From this excellent
      school he soon came forth the most accomplished negotiator of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the government of Charles had suffered a succession of
      humiliating disasters. The <span class="pagenum">34</span><a name="link34"
       id="link34"></a>extravagance of the court had dissipated all the means
      which Parliament had supplied for the purpose of carrying on offensive
      hostilities. It was determined to wage only a defensive war; and even for
      defensive war the vast resources of England, managed by triflers and
      public robbers, were found insufficient. The Dutch insulted the British
      coasts, sailed up the Thames, took Sheerness, and carried their ravages to
      Chatham. The blaze of the ships burning in the river was seen at London:
      it was rumoured that a foreign army had landed at Gravesend; and military
      men seriously proposed to abandon the Tower. To such a depth of infamy had
      a bad administration reduced that proud and victorious country, which a
      few years before had dictated its pleasure to Mazarine, to the
      States-General, and to the Vatican. Humbled by the events of the war, and
      dreading the just anger of Parliament, the English Ministry hastened to
      huddle up a peace with France and Holland at Breda.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a new scene was about to open. It had already been for some time
      apparent to discerning observers, that England and Holland were threatened
      by a common danger, much more formidable than any which they had reason to
      apprehend from each other. The old enemy of their independence and of
      their religion was no longer to be dreaded. The sceptre had passed away
      from Spain. That mighty empire, on which the sun never set, which had
      crushed the liberties of Italy and Germany, which had occupied Paris with
      its armies, and covered the British seas with its sails, was at the mercy
      of every spoiler; and Europe observed with dismay the rapid growth of a
      new and more formidable power. Men looked to Spain and saw only weakness
      disguised and increased by pride, <span class="pagenum">35</span><a
      name="link35" id="link35"></a>dominions of vast bulk and little strength,
      tempting, unwieldy, and defenceless, an empty treasury, a sullen and
      torpid nation, a child on the throne, factions in the council, ministers
      who served only themselves, and soldiers who were terrible only to their
      countrymen. Men looked to France, and saw a large and compact territory, a
      rich soil, a central situation, a bold, alert, and ingenious people, large
      revenues, numerous and well-disciplined troops, an active and ambitious
      prince, in the flower of his age, surrounded by generals of unrivalled
      skill. The projects of Lewis could be counteracted only by ability,
      vigour, and union on the part of his neighbours. Ability and vigour had
      hitherto been found in the councils of Holland alone, and of union there
      was no appearance in Europe. The question of Portuguese independence
      separated England from Spain. Old grudges, recent hostilities, maritime
      pretensions, commercial competition separated England as widely from the
      United Provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great object of Lewis, from the beginning to the end of his reign, was
      the acquisition of those large and valuable provinces of the Spanish
      monarchy, which lay contiguous to the eastern frontier of France. Already,
      before the conclusion of the treaty of Breda, he had invaded those
      provinces. He now pushed on his conquest with scarcely any resistance.
      Fortress after fortress was taken. Brussels itself was in danger; and
      Temple thought it wise to send his wife and children. to England. But his
      sister, Lady Giffard, who had been some time his inmate, and who seems to
      have been a more important personage in his family than his wife, still
      remained with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Witt saw the progress of the French arms with painful anxiety. But it
      was not in the power of <span class="pagenum">36</span><a name="link36"
       id="link36"></a>Holland alone to save Flanders; and the difficulty of
      forming an extensive coalition for that purpose appeared almost
      insuperable. Lewis, indeed, affected moderation. He declared himself
      willing to agree to a compromise with Spain. But these offers were
      undoubtedly mere professions, intended to quiet the apprehensions of the
      neighbouring powers; and, as his position became every day more and more
      advantageous, it was to be expected that he would rise in his demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of affairs when Temple obtained from the English
      Ministry permission to make a tour in Holland incognito. In company with
      Lady Gif-fard he arrived at the Hague. He was not charged with any public
      commission, but he availed himself of this opportunity of introducing
      himself to De Witt. &ldquo;My only business, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to see the
      things which are most considerable in your country, and I should execute
      my design very imperfectly if I went away without seeing you.&rdquo; De Witt,
      who from report had formed a high opinion of Temple, was pleased by the
      compliment, and replied with a frankness and cordiality which at once led
      to intimacy. The two statesmen talked calmly over the causes which had
      estranged England from Holland, congratulated each other on the peace, and
      then began to discuss the new dangers which menaced Europe. Temple, who
      had no authority to say any thing on behalf of the English Government,
      expressed himself very guardedly. De Witt, who was himself the Dutch
      Government, had no reason to be reserved. He openly declared that his wish
      was to see a general coalition formed for the preservation of Flanders.
      His simplicity and openness amazed Temple, who had been accustomed to the
      affected solemnity of his patron, the Secretary, and to <span
      class="pagenum">37</span><a name="link37" id="link37"></a>the eternal
      doublings and evasions which passed for great feats of statesmanship among
      the Spanish politicians at Brussels. &ldquo;Whoever,&rdquo; he wrote to Arlington,
      &ldquo;deals with M. de Witt must go the same plain way that he pretends to in
      his negotiations, without refining or colouring or offering shadow for
      substance.&rdquo; Temple was scarcely less struck by the modest dwelling and
      frugal table of the first citizen of the richest state in the world. While
      Clarendon was amazing London with a dwelling more sumptuous than the
      palace of his master, while Arlington was lavishing his ill-gotten wealth
      on the decoys and orange-gardens and interminable conservatories of
      Euston, the great statesman who had frustrated all their plans of
      conquest, and the roar of whose guns they had heard with terror even in
      the galleries of Whitehall, kept only a single servant, walked about the
      streets in the plainest garb, and never used a coach except for visits of
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple sent a full account of his interview with De Witt to Arlington,
      who, in consequence of the fall of the Chancellor, now shared with the
      Duke of Buckingham the principal direction of affairs. Arlington showed no
      disposition to meet the advances of the Dutch minister. Indeed, as was
      amply proved a few years later, both he and his master were perfectly
      willing to purchase the means of misgoverning England by giving up, not
      only Flanders, but the whole Continent, to France. Temple, who distinctly
      saw that a moment had arrived at which it was possible to reconcile his
      country with Holland, to reconcile Charles with the Parliament, to bridle
      the power of Lewis, to efface the shame of the late ignominious war, to
      restore England to the same place in Europe <span class="pagenum">38</span><a
      name="link38" id="link38"></a>which she had occupied under Cromwell,
      became more and more urgent in his representations. Arlington&rsquo;s replies
      were for some time couched in cold and ambiguous terms. But the events
      which followed the meeting of Parliament, in the autumn of 1667, appear to
      have produced an entire change in his views. The discontent of the nation
      was deep and general. The administration was attacked in all its parts.
      The King and the ministers laboured, not unsuccessfully, to throw on
      Clarendon the blame of past miscarriages; but though the Commons were
      resolved that the late Chancellor should be the first victim, it was by no
      means clear that he would be the last. The Secretary was personally
      attacked with great bitterness in the course of the debates. One of the
      resolutions of the Lower House against Clarendon was in truth a censure of
      the foreign policy of the Government, as too favourable to France. To
      these events chiefly we are inclined to attribute the change which at this
      crisis took place in the measures of England. The Ministry seem to have
      felt that, if they wished to derive any advantage from Clarendon&rsquo;s
      downfall, it was necessary for them to abandon what was supposed to be
      Clarendon&rsquo;s system, and by some splendid and popular measure to win the
      confidence of the nation. Accordingly, in December, 1667, Temple received
      a despatch containing instructions of the highest importance. The plan
      which he had so strongly recommended was approved; and he was directed to
      visit De Witt as speedily as possible, and to ascertain whether the States
      were willing to enter into an offensive and defensive league with England
      against the projects of France. Temple, accompanied by his sister,
      instantly set out for the Hague, and laid the propositions of the English
      Government before the Grand Pensionary. <span class="pagenum">39</span><a
      name="link39" id="link39"></a>The Dutch statesman answered with
      characteristic straightforwardness, that he was fully ready to agree to a
      defensive confederacy, but that it was the fundamental principle of the
      foreign policy of the States to make no offensive alliance under any
      circumstances whatever. With this answer Temple hastened from the Hague to
      London, had an audience of the King, related what had passed between
      himself and De Witt, exerted himself to remove the unfavourable opinion
      which had been conceived of the Grand Pensionary at the English court, and
      had the satisfaction of succeeding in all his objects. On the evening of
      the first of January, 1668, a council was held, at which Charles declared
      his resolution to unite with the Dutch on their own terms. Temple and his
      indefatigable sister immediately sailed again for the Hague, and, after
      weathering a violent storm in which they were very nearly lost, arrived in
      safety at the place of their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, as on every other, the dealings between Temple and De
      Witt were singularly fair and open. When they met, Temple began by
      recapitulating what had passed at their last interview. De Witt, who was
      as little given to lying with his face as with his tongue, marked his
      assent by his looks while the recapitulation proceeded, and, when it was
      concluded, answered that Temple&rsquo;s memory was perfectly correct, and
      thanked him for proceeding in so exact and sincere a manner. Temple then
      informed the Grand Pensionary that the King of England had determined to
      close with the proposal of a defensive alliance. De Witt had not expected
      so speedy a resolution; and his countenance indicated surprise as well as
      pleasure. But he did not retract, and it was speedily arranged that
      England and Holland should unite for the purpose <span class="pagenum">40</span><a
      name="link40" id="link40"></a>of compelling Lewis to abide by the
      compromise which he had formerly offered. The next object of the two
      statesmen was to induce another government to become a party to their
      league. The victories of Gustavus and Torstenson, and the political
      talents of Oxenstiern, had obtained for Sweden a consideration in Europe,
      disproportioned to her real power: the princes of Northern Germany stood
      in great awe of her; and De Witt and Temple agreed that if she could be
      induced to accede to the league, &ldquo;it would be too strong a bar for France
      to venture on.&rdquo; Temple went that same evening to Count Dona, the Swedish
      Minister at the Hague, took a seat in the most unceremonious manner, and,
      with that air of frankness and good-will, by which he often succeeded in
      rendering his diplomatic overtures acceptable, explained the scheme which
      was in agitation. Dona was greatly pleased and flattered. He had not
      powers which would authorize him to conclude a treaty of such importance.
      But he strongly advised Temple and De Witt to do their part without delay,
      and seemed confident that Sweden would accede. The ordinary course of
      public business in Holland was too slow for the present emergency; and De
      Witt appeared to have some scruples about breaking through the established
      forms. But the urgency and dexterity of Temple prevailed. The
      States-General took the responsibility of executing the treaty with a
      celerity unprecedented in the annals of the federation, and indeed
      inconsistent with its fundamental laws. The state of public feeling was,
      however, such in all the provinces, that this irregularity was not merely
      pardoned but applauded. When the instrument had been formally signed, the
      Dutch Commissioners embraced the English Plenipotentiary with the warmest
      expressions <span class="pagenum">41</span><a name="link41" id="link41"></a>of
      kindness and confidence. &ldquo;At Breda,&rdquo; exclaimed Temple, &ldquo;we embraced as
      friends, here as brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This memorable negotiation occupied only five days. De Witt complimented
      Temple in high terms on having effected in so short a time what must,
      under other management, have been the work of months; and Temple, in his
      despatches, spoke in equally high terms of De Witt. &ldquo;I must add these
      words, to do M. de Witt right, that I found him as plain, as direct and
      square in the course of this business as any man could be, though often
      stiff in points where he thought any advantage could accrue to his
      country; and have all the reason in the world to be satisfied with him;
      and for his industry, no man had ever more I am sure. For these five days
      at least, neither of us spent any idle hours, neither day nor night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sweden willingly acceded to the league, which is known in history by the
      name of the Triple Alliance; and, after some signs of ill-humour on the
      part of France, a general pacification was the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Triple Alliance may be viewed in two lights, as a measure of foreign
      policy, and as a measure of domestic policy; and under both aspects it
      seems to us deserving of all the praise which has been bestowed upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lingard, who is undoubtedly a very able and well-informed writer, but
      whose great fundamental rule of judging seems to be that the popular
      opinion on a historical question, cannot possibly be correct, speaks very
      slightingly of this celebrated treaty; and Mr. Courtenay, who by no means
      regards Temple with that profound veneration which is generally found in
      biographers, has conceded, in our opinion, far too much to Dr. Lingard.
      <span class="pagenum">42</span><a name="link42" id="link42"></a>The
      reasoning of Dr. Lingard is simply this. The Triple Alliance only
      compelled Lewis to make peace on the terms on which, before the alliance
      was formed, he had offered to make peace. How can it then be said that
      this alliance arrested his career, and preserved Europe from his ambition?
      Now, this reasoning is evidently of no force at all, except on the
      supposition that Lewis would have held himself bound by his former offers,
      if the alliance had not been formed; and, if Dr. Lingard thinks this a
      reasonable supposition, we should be disposed to say to him, in the words
      of that great politician, Mrs. Western; &ldquo;Indeed, brother, you would make a
      fine plenipo to negotiate with the French. They would soon persuade you
      that they take towns out of mere defensive principles.&rdquo; Our own impression
      is that Lewis made his offer only in order to avert some such measure as
      the Triple Alliance, and adhered to his offer only in consequence of that
      alliance. He had refused to consent to an armistice. He had made all his
      arrangements for a winter campaign. In the very week in which Temple and
      the States concluded their agreement at the Hague, Franche Comté was
      attacked by the French armies, and in three weeks the whole province was
      conquered. This prey Lewis was compelled to disgorge. And what compelled
      him? Did the object seem to him small or contemptible? On the contrary,
      the annexation of Franche Comté to his kingdom was one of the favourite
      projects of his life. Was he withheld by regard for his word? Did he, who
      never in any other transaction of his reign showed the smallest respect
      for the most solemn obligations of public faith, who violated the Treaty
      of the Pyrenees, who violated the Treaty of Aix, who violated the Treaty
      of Nimoguen, <span class="pagenum">43</span><a name="link43" id="link43"></a>who
      violated the Partition Treaty, who violated the Treaty of Utrecht, feel
      himself restrained by his word on this single occasion? Can any person who
      is acquainted with his character and with his whole policy doubt that, if
      the neighbouring powers would have looked quietly on, he would instantly
      have risen in his demands? How then stands the case? He wished to keep
      Franche Comté. It was not from regard to his word that he ceded Franche
      Comté. Why then did he cede Franche Comté? We answer, as all Europe
      answered at the time, from fear of the Triple Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But grant that Lewis was not really stopped in his progress by this famous
      league; still it is certain that the world then, and long after, believed
      that he was so stopped, and that this was the prevailing impression in
      France as well as in other countries. Temple, therefore, at the very
      least, succeeded in raising the credit of his country, and in lowering the
      credit of a rival power. Here there is no room for controversy. No
      grubbing among old state-papers will ever bring to light any document
      which will shake these facts; that Europe believed the ambition of France
      to have been curbed by the three powers; that England, a few months before
      the last among the nations, forced to abandon her own seas, unable to
      defend the mouths of her own rivers, regained almost as high a place in
      the estimation of her neighbours as she had held in the times of Elizabeth
      and Oliver; and that all this change of opinion was produced in five days
      by wise and resolute counsels, without the firing of a single gun. That
      the Triple Alliance effected this will hardly be disputed; and therefore,
      even if it effected nothing else, it must still be regarded as a
      master-piece of diplomacy. <span class="pagenum">44</span><a name="link44"
       id="link44"></a>Considered as a measure of domestic policy, this treaty
      seems to be equally deserving of approbation. It did much to allay
      discontents, to reconcile the sovereign with a people who had, under his
      wretched administration, become ashamed of him and of themselves. It was a
      kind of pledge for internal good government. The foreign relations of the
      kingdom had at that time the closest connection with our domestic policy.
      From the Restoration to the accession of the House of Hanover, Holland and
      France were to England what the right-hand horseman and the left-hand
      horseman in Burger&rsquo;s fine ballad were to the Wildgraf, the good and the
      evil counsellor, the angel of fight and the angel of darkness. The
      ascendency of France was inseparably connected with the prevalence of
      tyranny in domestic affairs. The ascendency of Holland was as inseparably
      connected with the prevalence of political liberty and of mutual
      toleration among Protestant sects. How fatal and degrading an influence
      Lewis was destined to exercise on the British counsels, how great a
      deliverance our country was destined to owe to the States, could not be
      foreseen when the Triple Alliance was concluded. Yet even then all
      discerning men considered it as a good omen for the English constitution
      and the reformed religion, that the Government had attached itself to
      Holland, and had assumed a firm and somewhat hostile attitude towards
      France. The fame of this measure was the greater, because it stood so
      entirely alone.. It was the single eminently good act performed by the
      Government during the interval between the Restoration and the Revolution.

</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">45</span><a name="link45" id="link45"></a>in it at
      all, battled for a share of the credit. The most parsimonious republicans
      were ready to grant money for the purpose of carrying into effect the
      provisions of this popular alliance; and the great Tory poet of that age,
      in his finest satires, repeatedly spoke with reverence of the &ldquo;triple
      bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This negotiation raised the fame of Temple both at home and abroad to a
      great height, to such a height, indeed, as seems to have excited the
      jealousy of his friend Arlington. While London and Amsterdam resounded
      with acclamations of joy, the Secretary, in very cold official language,
      communicated to his friend the approbation of the King; and, lavish as the
      Government was of titles and of money, its ablest servant was neither
      ennobled nor enriched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple&rsquo;s next mission was to Aix-la-Chapelle, where a general congress met
      for the purpose of perfecting the work of the Triple Alliance. On his road
      he received abundant proofs of the estimation in which he was held.
      Salutes were fired from the walls of the towns through which he passed;
      the population poured forth into the streets to see him; and the
      magistrates entertained him with speeches and banquets. After the close of
      the negotiations at Aix he was appointed Ambassador at the Hague. But in
      both these missions he experienced much vexation from the rigid, and,
      indeed, unjust parsimony of the Government. Profuse to many unworthy
      applicants, the Ministers were niggardly to him alone. They secretly
      disliked his politics; and they seem to have indemnified themselves for
      the humiliation of adopting his measures, by cutting down his salary and
      delaying the settlement of his outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Hague he was received with cordiality by De Witt, and with the most
      signal marks of respect by <span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link46"
       id="link46"></a>the States-General. His situation was in one point
      extremely delicate. The Prince of Orange, the hereditary chief of the
      faction opposed to the administration of De Witt, was the nephew of
      Charles. To preserve the confidence of the ruling party, without showing
      any want of respect to so near a relation of his own master, was no easy
      task. But Temple acquitted himself so well that he appears to have been in
      great favour, both with the Grand Pensionary and with the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the main, the years which he spent at the Hague seem, in spite of some
      pecuniary difficulties occasioned by the ill-will of the English
      Ministers, to have passed very agreeably. He enjoyed the highest personal
      consideration. He was surrounded by objects interesting in the highest
      degree to a man of his observant turn of mind. He had no wearing labour,
      no heavy responsibility; and, if he had no opportunity of adding to his
      high reputation, he ran no risk of impairing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But evil times were at hand. Though Charles had for a moment deviated into
      a wise and dignified policy, his heart had always been with France; and
      France employed every means of seduction to lure him back. His impatience
      of control, his greediness for money, his passion for beauty, his family
      affections, all his tastes, all his feelings, were practised on with the
      utmost dexterity. His interior Cabinet was now composed of men such as
      that generation, and that generation alone, produced; of men at whose
      audacious profligacy the renegades and jobbers of our own time look with
      the same sort of admiring despair with which our sculptors contemplate the
      Theseus, and our painters the Cartoons. To be a real, hearty, deadly enemy
      of the liberties and religion of the nation was, in that dark conclave, an
      honourable distinction, a distinction which belonged <span class="pagenum">47</span><a
      name="link47" id="link47"></a>only to the daring and impetuous Clifford.
      His associates were men to whom all creeds and all constitutions were
      alike; who were equally ready to profess the faith of Geneva, of Lambeth,
      and of Rome; who were equally ready to be tools of power without any sense
      of loyalty, and stirrers of sedition without any zeal for freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly possible even for a man so penetrating as De Witt to foresee
      to what depths of wickedness and infamy this execrable administration
      would descend. Yet, many signs of the great woe which was coming on
      Europe, the visit of the Duchess of Orleans to her brother, the
      unexplained mission of Buckingham to Paris, the sudden occupation of
      Lorraine by the French, made the Grand Pensionary uneasy; and his alarm
      increased when he learned that Temple had received orders to repair
      instantly to London. De Witt earnestly pressed for an explanation. Temple
      very sincerely replied that he hoped that the English Ministers would
      adhere to the principles of the Triple Alliance. &ldquo;I can answer,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;only for myself. But that I can do. If a new system is to be adopted, I
      will never have any part in it. I have told the King so; and I will make
      my words good. If I return you will know more: and if I do not return you
      will guess more.&rdquo; De Witt smiled, and answered that he would hope the
      best, and would do all in his power to prevent others from forming
      unfavourable surmises.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October, 1670, Temple reached London; and all his worst suspicions were
      immediately more than confirmed. He repaired to the Secretary&rsquo;s house, and
      was kept an hour and a half waiting in the ante-chamber, whilst Lord
      Ashley was closeted with Arlington. When at length the doors were thrown
      open, Arlington was <span class="pagenum">48</span><a name="link48"
       id="link48"></a>dry and cold, asked trifling questions about the voyage,
      and then, in order to escape from the necessity of discussing business,
      called in his daughter, an engaging little girl of three years old, who
      was long after described by poets &ldquo;as dressed in all the bloom of smiling
      nature,&rdquo; and whom Evelyn, one of the witnesses of her inauspicious
      marriage, mournfully designated as &ldquo;the sweetest, hopefullest, most
      beautiful child, and most virtuous too.&rdquo; Any particular conversation was
      impossible: and Temple, who with all his constitutional or philosophical
      indifference, was sufficiently sensitive on the side of vanity, felt this
      treatment keenly. The next day he offered himself to the notice of the
      King, who was snuffing up the morning air and feeding his ducks, in the
      Mall. Charles was civil, but, like Arlington, carefully avoided all
      conversation on politics. Temple found that all his most respectable
      friends were entirely excluded from the secrets of the inner council, and
      were awaiting in anxiety and dread for what those mysterious deliberations
      might produce. At length he obtained a glimpse of fight. The bold spirit
      and fierce passions of Clifford made him the most unfit of all men to be
      the keeper of a momentous secret. He told Temple, with great vehemence,
      that the States had behaved basely, that De Witt was a rogue and a rascal,
      that it was below the King of England, or any other king, to have any
      thing to do with such wretches; that this ought to be made known to all
      the world, and that it was the duty of the Minister at the Hague to
      declare it publicly. Temple commanded his temper as well as he could, and
      replied calmly and firmly, that he should make no such declaration, and
      that, if he were called upon to give his opinion of the States and their
      Ministers, he would say exactly what he thought. <span class="pagenum">49</span><a
      name="link49" id="link49"></a>He now saw clearly that the tempest was
      gathering fast, that the great alliance which he had formed and over which
      he had watched with parental care was about to be dissolved, that times
      were at hand when it would be necessary for him, if he continued in public
      life, either to take part decidedly against the Court, or to forfeit the
      high reputation which he enjoyed at home and abroad. He began to make
      preparations for retiring altogether from business. He enlarged a little
      garden which he had purchased at Sheen, and laid out some money in
      ornamenting his house there. He was still nominally ambassador to Holland;
      and the English Ministers continued during some months to flatter the
      States with the hope that he would speedily return. At length, in June,
      1671, the designs of the Cabal were ripe. The infamous treaty with France
      had been ratified. The season of deception was past, and that of insolence
      and violence had arrived. Temple received his formal dismission, kissed
      the King&rsquo;s hand, was repaid for his services with some of those vague
      compliments and promises which cost so little to the cold heart, the easy
      temper, and the ready tongue of Charles, and quietly withdrew to his
      little nest, as he called it, at Sheen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he amused himself with gardening, which he practised so successfully
      that the fame of his fruit-trees soon spread far and wide. But letters
      were his chief solace. He had, as we have mentioned, been from his youth
      in the habit of diverting himself with composition. The clear and
      agreeable language of his despatches had early attracted the notice of his
      employers; and, before the peace of Breda, he had, at the request of
      Arlington, published a pamphlet on the war, of which nothing is now known,
      except that it had some vogue at the time, and that Charles, not a
      contemptible <span class="pagenum">50</span><a name="link50" id="link50"></a>judge,
      pronounced it to be very well written. Temple had also, a short time
      before he began to reside at the Hague, written a treatise on the state of
      Ireland, in which he showed all the feelings of a Cromwellian. He had
      gradually formed a style singularly lucid and melodious, superficially
      deformed, indeed, by Gallicisms and Hispanicisms, picked up in travel or
      in negotiation, but at the bottom pure English, which generally flowed
      along with careless simplicity, but occasionally rose even into Ciceronean
      magnificence. The length of his sentences has often been remarked. But in
      truth this length is only apparent. A critic who considers as one sentence
      every thing that lies between two full stops will undoubtedly call
      Temple&rsquo;s sentences long. But a critic who examines them carefully will
      find that they are not swollen by parenthetical matter, that their
      structure is scarcely ever intricate, that they are formed merely by
      accumulation, and that, by the simple process of now and then leaving out
      a conjunction, and now and then substituting a full stop for a semicolon,
      they might, without any alteration in the order of the words, be broken up
      into very short periods, with no sacrifice except that of euphony. The
      long sentences of Hooker and Clarendon, on the contrary, are really long
      sentences, and cannot be turned into short ones, without being entirely
      taken to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best known of the works which Temple composed during his first retreat
      from official business are an Essay on Government, which seems to us
      exceedingly childish, and an Account of the United Provinces, which we
      value as a master-piece in its kind. Whoever compares these two treatises
      will probably agree with us in thinking that Temple was not a very deep or
      accurate reasoner, but was an excellent observer, <span class="pagenum">51</span><a
      name="link51" id="link51"></a>that he had no call to philosophical
      speculation, but that he was qualified to excel as a writer of Memoirs and
      Travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Temple was engaged in these pursuits, the great storm which had long
      been brooding over Europe burst with such fury as for a moment seemed to
      threaten ruin to all free governments and all Protestant churches. France
      and England, without seeking for any decent pretext, declared war against
      Holland. The immense armies of Lewis poured across the Rhine, and invaded
      the territory of the United Provinces. The Dutch seemed to be paralysed by
      terror. Great towns opened their gates to straggling parties. Regiments
      flung down their arms without seeing an enemy. Guelderland, Overyssel,
      Utrecht were overrun by the conquerors. The fires of the French camp were
      seen from the walls of Amsterdam. In the first madness of despair the
      devoted people turned their rage against the most illustrious of their
      fellow-citizens. De Ruyter was saved with difficulty from assassins. De
      Witt was torn to pieces by an infuriated rabble. No hope was left to the
      Commonwealth, save in the dauntless, the ardent, the indefatigable, the
      unconquerable spirit which glowed under the frigid demeanour of the young
      Prince of Orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      That great man rose at once to the full dignity of his part, and approved
      himself a worthy descendant of the line of heroes, who had vindicated the
      liberties of Europe against the house of Austria. Nothing could shake his
      fidelity to his country, not his close connection with the royal family of
      England, not the most earnest solicitations, not the most tempting offers.
      The spirit of the nation, that spirit which had maintained the great
      conflict against the gigantic power of Philip, <span class="pagenum">52</span><a
      name="link52" id="link52"></a>revived in all its strength. Counsels, such
      as are inspired by a generous despair, and are almost always followed by a
      speedy dawn of hope, were gravely concerted by the statesmen of Holland.
      To open their dykes, to man their ships, to leave their country, with all
      its miracles of art and industry, its cities, its canals, its villas, its
      pastures, and its tulip gardens, buried under the waves of the German
      ocean, to bear to a distant climate their Calvinistic faith and their old
      Batavian liberties, to fix, perhaps with happier auspices, the new
      Stadthouse of their Commonwealth, under other stars, and amidst a strange
      vegetation, in the Spice Islands of the Eastern seas; such were the plans
      which they had the spirit to form; and it is seldom that men who have the
      spirit to form such plans are reduced to the necessity of executing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Allies had, during a short period, obtained success beyond their
      hopes. This was their auspicious moment. They neglected to improve it. It
      passed away; and it returned no more. The Prince of Orange arrested the
      progress of the French armies. Lewis returned to be amused and flattered
      at Versailles. The country was under water. The winter approached. The
      weather became stormy. The fleets of the combined kings could no longer
      keep the sea. The republic had obtained a respite; and the circumstances
      were such that a respite was, in a military view, important, in a
      political view almost decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alliance against Holland, formidable as it was, was yet of such a
      nature that it could not succeed at all, unless it succeeded at once. The
      English Ministers could not carry on the war without money. They could
      legally obtain money only from the Parliament; and they were most
      unwilling to call the Parliament <span class="pagenum">53</span><a
      name="link53" id="link53"></a>together. The measures which Charles had
      adopted at home were even more unpopular than his foreign policy. He had
      bound himself by a treaty with Lewis to reestablish the Catholic religion
      in England; and, in pursuance of this design, he had entered on the same
      path which his brother afterwards trod with greater obstinacy to a more
      fatal end. The King had annulled, by his own sole authority, the laws
      against Catholics and other dissenters. The matter of the Declaration of
      Indulgence exasperated one half of his subjects, and the manner the other
      half. Liberal men would have rejoiced to see a toleration granted, at
      least to all Protestant sects. Many high churchmen had no objection to the
      King&rsquo;s dispensing power. But a tolerant act done in an unconstitutional
      way excited the opposition of all who were zealous either for the Church
      or for the privileges of the people, that is to say, of ninety-nine
      Englishmen out of a hundred. The ministers were, therefore, most unwilling
      to meet the Houses. Lawless and desperate as their counsels were, the
      boldest of them had too much value for his neck to think of resorting to
      benevolences, privy-seals, ship-money, or any of the other unlawful modes
      of extortion which had been familiar to the preceding age. The audacious
      fraud of shutting up the Exchequer furnished them with about twelve
      hundred thousand pounds, a sum which, even in better hands than theirs,
      would not have sufficed for the war-charges of a single year. And this was
      a step which could never be repeated, a step which, like most breaches of
      public faith, was speedily found to have caused pecuniary difficulties
      greater than those which it removed. All the money that could be raised
      was gone; Holland was not conquered; and the King Lad no resource but in a
      Parliament. <span class="pagenum">54</span><a name="link54" id="link54"></a>Had
      a general election taken place at this crisis, it is probable that the
      country would have sent up representatives as resolutely hostile to the
      Court as those who met in November, 1640; that the whole domestic and
      foreign policy of the Government would have been instantly changed; and
      that the members of the Cabal would have expiated their crimes on Tower
      Hill. But the House of Commons was still the same which had been elected
      twelve years before, in the midst of the transports of joy, repentance,
      and loyalty which followed the Restoration; and no pains had been spared
      to attach it to the Court by places, pensions, and bribes. To the great
      mass of the people it was scarcely less odious than the Cabinet itself.
      Yet, though it did not immediately proceed to those strong measures which
      a new House would in all probability have adopted, it was sullen and
      unmanageable, and undid, slowly indeed, and by degrees, but most
      effectually, all that the Ministers had done. In one session it
      annihilated their system of internal government. In a second session it
      gave a death-blow to their foreign policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispensing power was the first object of attack. The Commons would not
      expressly approve the war; but neither did they as yet expressly condemn
      it; and they were even willing to grant the King a supply for the purpose
      of continuing hostilities, on condition that he would redress internal
      grievances, among which the Declaration of Indulgence held the foremost
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaftesbury, who was Chancellor, saw that the game was up, that he had got
      all that was to be got by siding with despotism and Popery, and that it
      was high time to think of being a demagogue and a good Protestant. The
      Lord Treasurer Clifford was marked out by his <span class="pagenum">55</span><a
      name="link55" id="link55"></a>boldness, by his openness, by his zeal for
      the Catholic religion, by something which, compared with the villany of
      his colleagues, might almost be called honesty, to be the scapegoat of the
      whole conspiracy. The King came in person to the House of Peers for the
      purpose of requesting their Lordships to mediate between him and the
      Commons touching the Declaration of Indulgence. He remained in the House
      while his speech was taken into consideration; a common practice with him;
      for the debates amused his sated mind, and were sometimes, he used to say,
      as good as a comedy. A more sudden turn his Majesty had certainly never
      seen in any comedy of intrigue, either at his own play-house, or at the
      Duke&rsquo;s, than that which&rsquo; this memorable debate produced. The Lord
      Treasurer spoke with characteristic ardour and intrepidity in defence of
      the Declaration. When he sat down, the Lord Chancellor rose from the
      woolsack, and, to the amazement of the King and of the House, attacked
      Clifford, attacked the Declaration for which he had himself spoken in
      Council, gave up the whole policy of the Cabinet, and declared himself on
      the side of the House of Commons. Even that age had not witnessed so
      portentous a display of impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, by the advice of the French Court, which cared much more about
      the war on the Continent than about the conversion of the English
      heretics, determined to save his foreign policy at the expense of his
      plans in favour of the Catholic church. He obtained a supply; and in
      return for this concession he cancelled the Declaration of Indulgence and
      made a formal renunciation of the dispensing power before he prorogued the
      Houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was no more in his power to go on with the <span class="pagenum">56</span><a
      name="link56" id="link56"></a>war than to maintain his arbitrary system at
      home. His Ministry, betrayed within, and fiercely assailed from without,
      went rapidly to pieces. Clifford threw down the white staff, and retired
      to the woods of Ugbrook, vowing, with bitter tears, that he would never
      again see that turbulent city, and that perfidious Court. Shaftesbury was
      ordered to deliver up the Great Seal, and instantly carried over his front
      of brass and his tongue of poison to the ranks of the Opposition. The
      remaining members of the Cabal had neither the capacity of the late
      Chancellor, nor the courage and enthusiasm of the late Treasurer. They
      were not only unable to carry on their former projects, but began to
      tremble for their own lands and heads. The Parliament, as soon as it again
      met, began to murmur against the alliance with France and the war with
      Holland; and the murmur gradually swelled into a fierce and terrible
      clamour. Strong resolutions were adopted against Lauderdale and
      Buckingham. Articles of impeachment were exhibited against Arlington. The
      Triple Alliance was mentioned with reverence in every debate; and the eyes
      of all men were turned towards the quiet orchard, where the author of that
      great league was amusing himself with reading and gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was ordered to attend the King, and was charged with the office of
      negotiating a separate peace with Holland. The Spanish Ambassador to the
      Court of London had been empowered by the States-General to treat in their
      name. With him Temple came to a speedy agreement; and in three days a
      treaty was concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest honours of the State were now within Temple&rsquo;s reach. After the
      retirement of Clifford, the <span class="pagenum">57</span><a name="link57"
       id="link57"></a>white staff had been delivered to Thomas Osborne, soon
      after created Earl of Danby, who was related to Lady Temple, and had, many
      years earlier, travelled and played tennis with Sir William. Danby was an
      interested and dishonest man, but by no means destitute of abilities or of
      judgment. He was, indeed, a far better adviser than any in whom Charles
      had hitherto reposed confidence. Clarendon was a man of another
      generation, and did not in the least understand the society which he had
      to govern. The members of the Cabal were ministers of a foreign power, and
      enemies of the Established Church; and had in consequence raised against
      themselves and their master an irresistible storm of national and
      religious hatred. Danby wished to strengthen and extend the prerogative;
      but he had the sense to see that this could be done only by a complete
      change of system. He knew the English people and the House of Commons; and
      he knew that the course which Charles had recently taken, if obstinately
      pursued, might well end before the windows of the Banqueting-House. He saw
      that the true policy of the Crown was to ally itself, not with the feeble,
      the hated, the down-trodden Catholics, but with the powerful, the wealthy,
      the popular, the dominant Church of England; to trust for aid, not to a
      foreign Prince whose name was hateful to the British nation, and whose
      succours could be obtained only on terms of vassalage, but to the old
      Cavalier party, to the landed gentry, the clergy, and the universities. By
      rallying round the throne the whole strength of the Royalists and
      High-Churchmen, and by using without stint all the resources of
      corruption, he flattered himself that he could manage the Parliament. That
      he failed is to be attributed less to himself than to his master. <span
      class="pagenum">58</span><a name="link58" id="link58"></a>Of the
      disgraceful dealings which were still kept up with the French Court, Danby
      deserved little or none of the blame, though he suffered the whole
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danby, with great parliamentary talents, had paid little attention to
      European politics, and wished for the help of some person on whom he could
      rely in the foreign department. A plan was accordingly arranged for making
      Temple Secretary of State. Arlington was the only member of the Cabal who
      still held office in England. The temper of the House of Commons made it
      necessary to remove him, or rather to require him to sell out; for at that
      time the great offices of State were bought and sold as commissions in the
      army now are. Temple was informed that he should have the Seals if he
      would pay Arlington six thousand pounds. The transaction had nothing in it
      discreditable, according to the notions of that age, and the investment
      would have been a good one; for we imagine that at that time the gains
      which a Secretary of State might make, without doing any thing considered
      as improper, were very considerable. Temple&rsquo;s friends offered to lend him
      the money; but he was fully determined not to take a post of so much
      responsibility in times so agitated, and under a Prince on whom so little
      reliance could be placed, and accepted the embassy to the Hague, leaving
      Arlington to find another purchaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Temple left England he had a long audience of the King, to whom he
      spoke with great severity of the measures adopted by the late Ministry.
      The King owned that things had turned out ill. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I had
      been well served, I might have made a good business of it.&rdquo; Temple was
      alarmed at this language, <span class="pagenum">59</span><a name="link59"
       id="link59"></a>and inferred from it that the system of the Cabal had not
      been abandoned, but only suspended. He therefore thought it his duty to
      go, as he expressed it, &ldquo;to the bottom of the matter.&rdquo; He strongly
      represented to the King the impossibility of establishing either absolute
      government, or the Catholic religion in England; and concluded by
      repeating an observation which he had heard at Brussels from M. Gourville,
      a very intelligent Frenchman well known to Charles: &ldquo;A King of England,&rdquo;
       said Gourville, &ldquo;who is willing to be the man of his people, is the
      greatest king in the world, but if he wishes to be more, by heaven he is
      nothing at all!&rdquo; The King betrayed some symptoms of impatience during this
      lecture; but at last he laid his hand kindly on Temple&rsquo;s shoulder, and
      said, &ldquo;You are right, and so is Gourville; and I will be the man of my
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this assurance Temple repaired to the Hague in July, 1674. Holland
      was now secure, and France was surrounded on every side by enemies. Spain
      and the Empire were in arms for the purpose of compelling Lewis to abandon
      all that he had acquired since the treaty of the Pyrenees. A congress for
      the purpose of putting an end to the war was opened at Nimeguen under the
      mediation of England in 1675; and to that congress Temple was deputed. The
      work of conciliation, however, went on very slowly. The belligerent powers
      were still sanguine, and the mediating power was unsteady and insincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time the Opposition in England became more and more
      formidable, and seemed fully determined to force the King into a war with
      France. Charles was desirous of making some appointments which might
      strengthen the administration and conciliate the confidence of the public.
      No man was more esteemed by <span class="pagenum">60</span><a name="link60"
       id="link60"></a>the nation than Temple; yet he had never been concerned in
      any opposition to any government. In July, 1677, he was sent for from
      Nimeguen. Charles received him with caresses, earnestly pressed him to
      accept the seals of Secretary of State, and promised to bear half the
      charge of buying out the present holder. Temple was charmed by the
      kindness and politeness of the King&rsquo;s manner, and by the liveliness of his
      Majesty&rsquo;s conversation; but his prudence was not to be so laid asleep. He
      calmly and steadily excused himself. The King affected to treat his
      excuses as mere jests, and gaily said, &ldquo;Go; get you gone to Sheen. We
      shall have no good of you till you have been there; and when you have
      rested yourself, come up again.&rdquo; Temple withdrew and staid two days at his
      villa, but returned to town in the same mind; and the King was forced to
      consent at least to a delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Temple thus carefully shunned the responsibility of bearing a
      part in the general direction of affairs, he gave a signal proof of that
      never-failing sagacity which enabled him to find out ways of
      distinguishing himself without risk. He had a principal share in bringing
      about an event which was at the time hailed with general satisfaction, and
      which subsequently produced consequences of the highest importance. This
      was the marriage of the Prince of Orange and the Lady Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following year Temple returned to the Hague; and thence he was
      ordered, in the close of 1678, to repair to Nimeguen, for the purpose of
      signing the hollow and unsatisfactory treaty by which the distractions of
      Europe were for a short time suspended. He grumbled much at being required
      to affix his name to bad articles which he had not framed, and still more
      at having to <span class="pagenum">61</span><a name="link61" id="link61"></a>travel
      in very cold weather. After all, a difficulty of etiquette prevented him
      from signing, and he returned to the Hague. Scarcely had he arrived there
      when he received intelligence that the King, whose embarrassments were now
      far greater than ever, was fully resolved immediately to appoint him
      Secretary of State. He a third time declined that high post, and began to
      make preparations for a journey to Italy; thinking, doubtless, that he
      should spend his time much more pleasantly among pictures and ruins than
      in such a whirlpool of political and religious frenzy as was then raging
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the King was in extreme necessity, and was no longer to be so easily
      put off. Temple received positive orders to repair instantly to England.
      He obeyed, and found the country in a state even more fearful than that
      which he had pictured to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are terrible conjunctures, when the discontents of a nation, not
      light and capricious discontents, but discontents which have been steadily
      increasing during a long series of years, have attained their full
      maturity. The discerning few predict the approach of these conjunctures,
      but predict in vain. To the many, the evil season comes as a total eclipse
      of the sun at noon comes to a people of savages. Society which, but a
      short time before, was in a state of perfect repose, is on a sudden
      agitated with the most fearful convulsions, and seems to be on the verge
      of dissolution; and the rulers who, till the mischief was beyond the reach
      of all ordinary remedies, had never bestowed one thought on its existence,
      stand bewildered and panic-stricken, without hope or resource, in the
      midst of the confusion. One such conjuncture this generation has seen. God
      grant that we may never <span class="pagenum">62</span><a name="link62"
       id="link62"></a>see another! At such a conjuncture it was that Temple
      landed on English ground in the beginning of 1679.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament had obtained a glimpse of the King&rsquo;s dealings with France;
      and their anger had been unjustly directed against Danby, whose conduct as
      to that matter had been, on the whole, deserving rather of praise than of
      censure. The Popish Plot, the murder of Godfrey, the infamous inventions
      of Oates, the discovery of Colman&rsquo;s letters, had excited the nation to
      madness. All the disaffection which had been generated by eighteen years
      of misgovernment had come to the birth together. At this moment the King
      had been advised to dissolve that Parliament which had been elected just
      after his restoration, and which, though its composition had since that
      time been greatly altered, was still far more deeply imbued with the old
      cavalier spirit than any that had preceded, or that was likely to follow
      it. The general election had commenced, and was proceeding with a degree
      of excitement never before known. The tide ran furiously against the
      Court. It was clear that a majority of the New House of Commons would be,
      to use a word which came into fashion a few months later, decided Whigs.
      Charles had found it necessary to yield to the violence of the public
      feeling. The Duke of York was on the point of retiring to Holland. &ldquo;I
      never,&rdquo; says Temple, who had seen the abolition of monarchy, the
      dissolution of the Long Parliament, the fall of the Protectorate, the
      declaration of Monk against the Rump, &ldquo;I never saw greater disturbance in
      men&rsquo;s minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King now with the utmost urgency besought Temple to take the seals.
      The pecuniary part of the <span class="pagenum">63</span><a name="link63"
       id="link63"></a>arrangement no longer presented any difficulty; and Sir
      William was not quite so decided in his refusal as he had formerly been.
      He took three days to consider the posture of affairs, and to examine his
      own feelings; and he came to the conclusion that &ldquo;the scene was unfit for
      such an actor as he knew himself to be.&rdquo; Yet he felt that, by refusing
      help to the King at such a crisis, he might give much offence and incur
      much censure. He shaped his course with his usual dexterity. He affected
      to be very desirous of a seat in Parliament; yet he contrived to be an
      unsuccessful candidate; and, when all the writs were returned, he
      represented that it would be useless for him to take the seals till he
      could procure admittance to the House of Commons; and in this manner he
      succeeded in avoiding the greatness which others desired to thrust upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament met; and the violence of its proceedings surpassed all
      expectation. The Long Parliament itself, with much greater provocation,
      had at its commencement been less violent. The Treasurer was instantly
      driven from office, impeached, sent to the Tower. Sharp and vehement votes
      were passed on the subject of the Popish Plot. The Commons were prepared
      to go much further, to wrest from the King his prerogative of mercy in
      cases of high political crimes, and to alter the succession to the Crown.
      Charles was thoroughly perplexed and dismayed. Temple saw him almost
      daily, and thought him impressed with a deep sense of his errors, and of
      the miserable state into which they had brought him. Their conferences
      became longer and more confidential: and Temple began to flatter himself
      with the hope that he might be able to reconcile parties at home as he had
      reconciled hostile <span class="pagenum">64</span><a name="link64"
       id="link64"></a>States abroad; that he might be able to suggest a plan
      which should allay all heats, efface the memory of all past grievances,
      secure the nation from misgovernment, and protect the Crown against the
      encroachments of Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple&rsquo;s plan was that the existing Privy Council, which consisted of
      fifty members, should be dissolved, that there should no longer be a small
      interior council, like that which is now designated as the Cabinet, that a
      new Privy Council of thirty members should be appointed, and that the King
      should pledge himself to govern by the constant advice of this body, to
      suffer all his affairs of every kind to be freely debated there, and not
      to reserve any part of the public business for a secret committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen of the members of this new council were to be great officers of
      State. The other fifteen were to be independent noblemen and gentlemen of
      the greatest weight in the country. In appointing them particular regard
      was to be had to the amount of their property. The whole annual income of
      the counsellors was estimated at 300,000l. The annual income of all the
      members of the House of Commons was not supposed to exceed 400,000l. The
      appointment of wealthy counsellors Temple describes as &ldquo;a chief regard,
      necessary to this constitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This plan was the subject of frequent conversation between the King and
      Temple. After a month passed in discussions to which no third person
      appears to have been privy Charles declared himself satisfied of the
      expediency of the proposed measure, and resolved to carry it into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much to be regretted that Temple has left us no account of these
      conferences. Historians have, <span class="pagenum">65</span><a
      name="link65" id="link65"></a>therefore, been left to form their own
      conjectures as to the object of this very extraordinary plan, &ldquo;this
      Constitution,&rdquo; as Temple himself calls it. And we cannot say that any
      explanation which has yet been given seems to us quite satisfactory.
      Indeed, almost all the writers whom we have consulted appear to consider
      the change as merely a change of administration, and so considering it,
      they generally applaud it. Mr. Courtenay, who has evidently examined this
      subject with more attention than has often been bestowed upon it, seems to
      think Temple&rsquo;s scheme very strange, unintelligible, and absurd. It is with
      very great diffidence that we offer our own solution of what we have
      always thought one of the great riddles of English history. We are
      strongly inclined to suspect that the appointment of the new Privy Council
      was really a much more remarkable event than has generally been supposed,
      and that what Temple had in view was to effect, under colour of a change
      of administration, a permanent change in the Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan, considered merely as a plan for the formation of a Cabinet, is
      so obviously inconvenient, that we cannot easily believe this to have been
      Temple&rsquo;s chief object. The number of the new Council alone would be a most
      serious objection. The largest cabinets of modern times have not, we
      believe, consisted of more than fifteen members. Even this number has
      generally been thought too large. The Marquess Wellesley, whose judgment
      on a question of executive administration is entitled to as much respect
      as that of any states man that England ever produced, expressed, during
      the ministerial negotiations of the year 1812, his conviction that even
      thirteen was an inconveniently large number. But in a Cabinet of thirty
      members what chance could <span class="pagenum">66</span><a name="link66"
       id="link66"></a>there he of finding unity, secrecy, expedition, any of the
      qualities which such a body ought to possess? If, indeed, the members of
      such a Cabinet were closely bound together by interest, if they all had a
      deep stake in the permanence of the Administration, if the majority were
      dependent on a small number of leading men, the thirty might perhaps act
      as a smaller number would act, though more slowly, more awkwardly, and
      with more risk of improper disclosures. But the Council which Temple
      proposed was so framed that if, instead of thirty members, it had
      contained only ten, it would still have been the most unwieldy and
      discordant Cabinet that ever sat. One half of the members were to be
      persons holding no office, persons who had no motive to compromise their
      opinions, or to take any share of the responsibility of an unpopular
      measure, persons, therefore, who might be expected, as often as there
      might be a crisis requiring the most cordial co-operation, to draw off
      from the rest, and to throw every difficulty in the way of the public
      business. The circumstance that they were men of enormous private wealth
      only made the matter worse. The House of Commons is a checking body; and
      therefore it is desirable that it should, to a great extent, consist of
      men of independent fortune, who receive nothing and expect nothing from
      the Government. But with executive boards the case is quite different.
      Their business is not to check, but to act. The very same things,
      therefore, which are the virtues of Parliaments may be vices in Cabinets.
      We can hardly conceive a greater curse to the country than an
      Administration, the members of which should be as perfectly independent of
      each other, and as little under the necessity of making mutual
      concessions, as the representatives of London and Devonshire in the House
      of <span class="pagenum">67</span><a name="link67" id="link67"></a>Commons
      are and ought to be. Now Temple&rsquo;s new Council was to contain fifteen
      members who were to hold no offices, and the average amount of whose
      private estates was ten thousand pounds a year, an income which, in
      proportion to the wants of a man of rank of that period, was at least
      equal to thirty thousand a year in our time. Was it to be expected that
      such men would gratuitously take on themselves the labour and
      responsibility of Ministers, and the unpopularity which the best Ministers
      must sometimes be prepared to brave? Could there be any doubt that an
      Opposition would soon be formed within the Cabinet itself, and that the
      consequence would be disunion, altercation, tardiness in operations, the
      divulging of secrets, every thing most alien from the nature of an
      executive council?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it possible to imagine that considerations so grave and so obvious
      should have altogether escaped the notice of a man of Temple&rsquo;s sagacity
      and experience? One of two things appears to us to be certain, either that
      his project has been misunderstood, or that his talents for public affairs
      have been overrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lean to the opinion that his project has been misunderstood. His new
      Council, as we have shown, would have been an exceedingly bad Cabinet. The
      inference which we are inclined to draw is this, that he meant his Council
      to serve some other purpose than that of a mere Cabinet. Barillon used
      four or five words, which contain, we think, the key of the whole mystery.
      Mr. Courtenay calls them pithy words; but he does not, if we are right,
      apprehend their whole force. &ldquo;Ce sont,&rdquo; said Barillon, &ldquo;des États, non des
      conseils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In order clearly to understand what we imagine to have been Temple&rsquo;s
      views, the reader must remember <span class="pagenum">68</span><a
      name="link68" id="link68"></a>that the Government of England was at that
      moment, and had been during nearly eighty years, in a state of transition.
      A change, not the less real or the less extensive because disguised under
      ancient names and forms, was in constant progress. The theory of the
      Constitution, the fundamental laws which fix the powers of the three
      branches of the legislature, underwent no material change between the time
      of Elizabeth and the time of William the Third. The most celebrated laws
      of the seventeenth century on those subjects, the Petition of Right, the
      Declaration of Right, are purely declaratory. They purport to be merely
      recitals of the old polity of England. They do not establish free
      government as a salutary improvement, but claim it as an undoubted and
      immemorial inheritance. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that, during
      the period of which we speak, all the mutual relations of all the orders
      of the State did practically undergo an entire change. The letter of the
      law might be unaltered; but at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
      the power of the crown was, in fact, decidedly predominant in the State;
      and at the end of that century the power of Parliament, and especially of
      the Lower House, had become in fact, decidedly predominant. At the
      beginning of the century, the sovereign perpetually violated, with little
      or no opposition, the clear privileges of Parliament. At the close of the
      century, the Parliament had virtually drawn to itself just as much as it
      chose of the prerogative of the Crown. The sovereign retained the shadow
      of that authority of which the Tudors had held the substance. He had a
      legislative veto which he never ventured to exercise, a power of
      appointing Ministers, whom an address of the Commons could at any moment
      force him to discard, a power of declaring <span class="pagenum">69</span><a
      name="link69" id="link69"></a>war which, without Parliamentary support,
      could not be carried on for a single day. The Houses of Parliament were
      now not merely legislative assemblies, not merely checking assemblies.
      They were great Councils of State, whose voice, when loudly and firmly
      raised, was decisive on all questions of foreign and domestic policy.
      There was no part of the whole system of Government with which they had
      not power to interfere by advice equivalent to command; and, if they
      abstained from intermeddling with some departments of the executive
      administration, they were withheld from doing so only by their own
      moderation, and by the confidence which they reposed in the Ministers of
      the Crown. There is perhaps no other instance in history of a change so
      complete in the real constitution of an empire, unaccompanied by any
      corresponding change in the theoretical constitution. The disguised
      transformation of the Roman commonwealth into a despotic monarchy, under
      the long administration of Augustus, is perhaps the nearest parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great alteration did not take place without strong and constant
      resistance on the part of the kings of the house of Stewart. Till 1642,
      that resistance was generally of an open, violent, and lawless nature. If
      the Commons refused supplies, the sovereign levied a benevolence. If the
      Commons impeached a favourite minister, the sovereign threw the chiefs of
      the Opposition into prison. Of these efforts to keep down the Parliament
      by despotic force, without the pretext of law, the last, the most
      celebrated, and the most wicked was the attempt to seize the five members.
      That attempt was the signal for civil war, and was followed by eighteen
      years of blood and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days of trouble passed by; the exiles returned; <span class="pagenum">70</span><a
      name="link70" id="link70"></a>the throne was again set up in its high
      place; the peerage and the hierarchy recovered their ancient splendour.
      The fundamental laws which had been recited in the Petition of Right were
      again solemnly recognised. The theory of the English constitution was the
      same on the day when the hand of Charles the Second was kissed by the
      kneeling Houses at Whitehall as on the day when his father set up the
      royal standard at Nottingham. There was a short period of doting fondness,
      a <i>hysterica passio</i> of loyal repentance and love. But emotions of
      this sort are transitory; and the interests on which depends the progress
      of great societies are permanent. The transport of reconciliation was soon
      over; and the old struggle recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old struggle recommenced; but not precisely after the old fashion. The
      sovereign was not indeed a man whom any common warning would have
      restrained from the grossest violations of law. But it was no common
      warning that he had received. All around him were the recent signs of the
      vengeance of an oppressed nation, the fields on which the noblest blood of
      the island had been poured forth, the castles shattered by the cannon of
      the Parliamentary armies, the hall where sat the stern tribunal to whose
      bar had been led, through lowering ranks of pikemen, the captive heir of a
      hundred kings, the stately pilasters before which the great execution had
      been so fearlessly done in the face of heaven and earth. The restored
      Prince, admonished by the fate of his father, never ventured to attack his
      Parliaments with open and arbitrary violence. It was at one time by means
      of the Parliament itself, at another time by means of the courts of law,
      that he attempted to regain for the Crown its old predominance. He began
      with great advantages. The <span class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link71"
       id="link71"></a>Parliament of 1661 was called while the nation was still
      full of joy and tenderness. The great majority of the House of Commons
      were zealous royalists. All the means of influence which the patronage of
      the Crown afforded were used without limit. Bribery was reduced to a
      system. The King, when he could spare money from his pleasures for nothing
      else, could spare it for purposes of corruption. While the defence of the
      coasts was neglected, while ships rotted, while arsenals lay empty, while
      turbulent crowds of unpaid seamen swarmed in the streets of the seaports,
      something could still be scraped together in the Treasury for the members
      of the House of Commons. The gold of France was largely employed for the
      same purpose. Yet it was found, as indeed might have been foreseen, that
      there is a natural limit to the effect which can be produced by means like
      these. There is one thing which the most corrupt senates are unwilling to
      sell; and that is the power which makes them worth buying. The same
      selfish motives which induced them to take a price for a particular vote
      induce them to oppose every measure of which the effect would be to lower
      the importance, and consequently the price, of their votes. About the
      income of their power, so to speak, they are quite ready to make bargains.
      But they are not easily persuaded to part with any fragment of the
      principal. It is curious to observe how, during the long continuance of
      this Parliament, the Pensionary Parliament, as it was nicknamed by
      contemporaries, though every circumstance seemed to be favourable to the
      Crown, the power of the Crown was constantly sinking, and that of the
      Commons constantly rising. The meetings of the Houses were more frequent
      than in former reigns; their interference was <span class="pagenum">72</span><a
      name="link72" id="link72"></a>more harassing to the Government than in
      former reigns; they had begun to make peace, to make war, to pull down, if
      they did not set up, administrations. Already a new class of statesmen had
      appeared, unheard of before that time, but common ever since. Under the
      Tudors and the earlier Stuarts, it was generally by courtly arts, or by
      official skill and knowledge, that a politician raised himself to power.
      From the time of Charles the Second down to our own days a different
      species of talent, parliamentary talent, has been the most valuable of all
      the qualifications of an English statesman. It has stood in the place of
      all other acquirements. It has covered ignorance, weakness, rashness, the
      most fatal maladministration. A great negotiator is nothing when compared
      with a great debater; and a minister who can make a successful speech need
      trouble himself little about an unsuccessful expedition. This is the
      talent which has made judges without law, and diplomatists without French,
      which has sent to the Admiralty men who did not know the stern of a ship
      from her bowsprit, and to the India Board men who did not know the
      difference between a rupee and a pagoda, which made a foreign secretary of
      Mr. Pitt, who, as George the Second said, had never opened Yattel, and
      which was very near making a Chancellor of the Exchequer of Mr. Sheridan,
      who could not work a sum in long division. This was the sort of talent
      which raised Clifford from obscurity to the head of affairs. To this
      talent Osborne, by birth a simple country gentleman, owed his white staff,
      his garter, and his dukedom. The encroachment of the power of the
      Parliament on the power of the Crown resembled, a fatality, or the
      operation of some great law of nature. The will of the individual on the
      <span class="pagenum">73</span><a name="link73" id="link73"></a>throne, or
      of the individuals in the two Houses, seemed to go for nothing. The King
      might be eager to encroach; yet something constantly drove him back. The
      Parliament might be loyal, even servile; yet something constantly urged
      them forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things were done in the green tree. What then was likely to be done
      in the dry? The Popish Plot and the general election came together, and
      found a people predisposed to the most violent excitation. The composition
      of the House of Commons was changed. The Legislature was filled with men
      who leaned to Republicanism in politics, and to Presbyterianism in
      religion. They no sooner met than they commenced an attack on the
      Government which, if successful, must have made them supreme in the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was this to end? To us who have seen the solution the question
      presents few difficulties. But to a statesman of the age of Charles the
      Second, to a statesman who wished, without depriving the Parliament of its
      privileges, to maintain the monarch in his old supremacy, it must have
      appeared very perplexing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarendon had, when Minister, struggled, honestly, perhaps, but, as was
      his wont, obstinately, proudly, and offensively, against the growing power
      of the Commons. He was for allowing them their old authority, and not one
      atom more. He would never have claimed for the Crown a right to levy taxes
      from the people without the consent of Parliament. But when the
      Parliament, in the first Dutch war, most properly insisted on knowing how
      it was that the money which they had voted had produced so little effect,
      and began to inquire through what hands it had passed, and on what
      services it had been expended, <span class="pagenum">74</span><a
      name="link74" id="link74"></a>Clarendon considered this as a monstrous
      innovation. He told the King, as he himself says, &ldquo;that he could not be
      too indulgent in the defence of the privileges of Parliament, and that he
      hoped he would never violate any of them; but he desired him to be equally
      solicitous to prevent the excesses in Parliament, and not to suffer them
      to extend their jurisdiction to cases they have nothing to do with; and
      that to restrain them within their proper bounds and limits is as
      necessary as it is to preserve them from being invaded; and that this was
      such a new encroachment as had no bottom.&rdquo; This is a single instance.
      Others might easily be given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bigotry, the strong passions, the haughty and disdainful temper, which
      made Clarendon&rsquo;s great abilities a source of utmost un mixed evil to
      himself and to the public, had no place in the character of Temple. To
      Temple, however, as well as to Clarendon, the rapid change which was
      taking place in the real working of the Constitution gave great disquiet;
      particularly as Temple had never sat in the English Parliament, and
      therefore regarded it with none of the predilection which men naturally
      feel for a body to which they belong, and for a theatre on which their own
      talents have been advantageously displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To wrest by force from the House of Commons its newly acquired powers was
      impossible; nor was Temple a man to recommend such a stroke, even if it
      had been possible. But was it possible that the House of Commons might be
      induced to let those powers drop? Was it possible that, as a great
      revolution had been effected without any change in the outward form of the
      Government, so a great counter-revolution might be effected in the same
      manner? Was it possible that the <span class="pagenum">75</span><a
      name="link75" id="link75"></a>Crown and the Parliament might be placed in
      nearly the same relative position in which they had stood in the reign of
      Elizabeth, and that this might be done without one sword drawn, without
      one execution, and with the general acquiescence of the nation?
    </p>
    <p>
      The English people&mdash;it was probably thus that Temple argued&mdash;will
      not bear to be governed by the unchecked power of the sovereign, nor ought
      they to be so governed. At present there is no check but the Parliament.
      The limits which separate the power of checking those who govern from the
      power of governing are not easily to be defined. The Parliament,
      therefore, supported by the nation, is rapidly drawing to itself all the
      powers of Government. If it were possible to frame some other check on the
      power of the Crown, some check which might be less galling to the
      sovereign than that by which he is now constantly tormented, and yet which
      might appear to the people to be a tolerable security against
      maladministration, Parliaments would probably meddle less; and they would
      be less supported by public opinion in their meddling. That the King&rsquo;s
      hands may not be rudely tied by others, he must consent to tie them
      lightly himself. That the executive administration may not be usurped by
      the checking body, something of the character of a checking body must be
      given to the body which conducts the executive administration. The
      Parliament is now arrogating to itself every day a larger share of the
      functions of the Privy Council. We must stop the evil by giving to the
      Privy Council something of the constitution of a Parliament. Let the
      nation see that all the King&rsquo;s measures are directed by a Cabinet composed
      of representatives of every order in the State, by a Cabinet which
      contains, not placemen alone, but independent <span class="pagenum">76</span><a
      name="link76" id="link76"></a>and popular noblemen and gentlemen who have
      large estates and no salaries, and who are not likely to sacrifice the
      public welfare in which they have a deep stake, and the credit which they
      have obtained with the country, to the pleasure of a Court from which they
      receive nothing. When the ordinary administration is in such hands as
      these, the people will be quite content to see the Parliament become, what
      it formerly was, an extraordinary check. They will be quite willing that
      the House of Commons should meet only once in three years for a short
      session, and should take as little part in matters of state as it did a
      hundred years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we believe that Temple reasoned: for on this hypothesis his scheme is
      intelligible; and on any other hypothesis his scheme appears to us, as it
      does to Mr. Courtenay, exceedingly absurd and unmeaning. This Council was
      strictly what Barillon called it, an Assembly of States. There are the
      representatives of all the great sections of the community, of the Church,
      of the law, of the Peerage, of the Commons. The exclusion of one half of
      the counsellors from office under the Crown, an exclusion which is quite
      absurd when we consider the Council merely as an executive board, becomes
      at once perfectly reasonable when we consider the Council as a body
      intended to restrain the Crown as well as to exercise the powers of the
      Crown, to perform some of the functions of a Parliament as well as the
      functions of a Cabinet. We see, too, why Temple dwelt so much on the
      private wealth of the members, why he instituted a comparison between
      their united incomes and the united incomes of the members of the House of
      Commons. Such a parallel would have been idle in the case of a mere
      Cabinet. It is extremely significant in the case of a body intended <span
      class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link77" id="link77"></a>to supersede the
      House of Commons in some very important functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can hardly help thinking that the notion of this Parliament on a small
      scale was suggested to Temple by what he had himself seen in the United
      Provinces. The original Assembly of the States-General consisted, as he
      tells us, of above eight hundred persons. But this great body was
      represented by a smaller Council of about thirty, which bore the name and
      exercised the powers of the States-General. At last the real States
      altogether ceased to meet; and their power, though still a part of the
      theory of the Constitution, became obsolete in practice. We do not, of
      course, imagine that Temple either expected or wished that Parliaments
      should be thus disused; but he did expect, we think, that something like
      what had happened in Holland would happen in England, and that a large
      portion of the functions lately assumed by Parliament would be quietly
      transferred to the miniature Parliament which he proposed to create.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had this plan, with some modifications, been tried at an earlier period,
      in a more composed state of the public mind, and by a better sovereign, we
      are by no means certain that it might not have effected the purpose for
      which it was designed. The restraint imposed on the King by the Council of
      Thirty, whom he had himself chosen, would have been feeble indeed when
      compared with the restraint imposed by Parliament. But it would have been
      more constant. It would have acted every year, and all the year round; and
      before the Revolution the sessions of Parliament were short and the
      recesses long. The advice of the Council would probably have prevented any
      very monstrous and scandalous measures; and would consequently <span
      class="pagenum">78</span><a name="link78" id="link78"></a>have prevented
      the discontents which follow such measures, and the salutary laws which
      are the fruit of such discontents. We believe, for example, that the
      second Dutch war would never have been approved by such a Council as that
      which Temple proposed. We are quite certain that the shutting up of the
      Exchequer would never even have been mentioned in such a Council. The
      people, pleased to think that Lord Russell, Lord Cavendish, and Mr. Powle,
      unplaced and unpensioned, were daily representing their grievances and
      defending their rights in the Royal presence, would not have pined quite
      so much for the meeting of Parliaments. The Parliament, when it met, would
      have found fewer and less glaring abuses to attack. There would have been
      less misgovernment and less reform. We should not have been cursed with
      the Cabal, or blessed with the Habeas Corpus Act. In the mean time the
      Council, considered as an executive Council, would, unless some at least
      of its powers had been delegated to a smaller body, have been feeble,
      dilatory, divided, unfit for every thing which requires secrecy and
      despatch, and peculiarly unfit for the administration of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revolution put an end, in a very different way, to the long contest
      between the King and the Parliament. From that time, the House of Commons
      has been predominant in the State. The Cabinet has really been, from that
      time, a committee nominated by the Crown out of the prevailing party in
      Parliament. Though the minority in the Commons are constantly proposing to
      condemn executive measures, or to call for papers which may enable the
      House to sit in judgment on such measures, these propositions are scarcely
      ever carried; and, if a proposition of this kind is carried <span
      class="pagenum">79</span><a name="link79" id="link79"></a>against the
      Government, a change of Ministry almost necessarily follows. Growing and
      struggling power always gives more annoyance and is more unmanageable than
      established power. The House of Commons gave infinitely more trouble to
      the Ministers of Charles the Second than to any Ministers of later times;
      for, in the time of Charles the Second, the House was checking Ministers
      in whom it did not confide. Now that its ascendency is fully established,
      it either confides in Ministers or turns them out. This is undoubtedly a
      far better state of tilings than that which Temple wished to introduce.
      The modern Cabinet is a far better executive Council than his. The worst
      House of Commons that has sate since the Revolution was a far more
      efficient check on misgovemment than his fifteen independent counsellors
      would have been. Yet, every thing considered, it seems to us that his plan
      was the work of an observant, ingenious, and fertile mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, as on every occasion on which he came prominently
      forward, Temple had the rare good fortune to please the public as well as
      the Sovereign. The general exultation was great when it was known that the
      old Council, made up of the most odious tools of power, was dismissed,
      that small interior committees, rendered odious by the recent memory of
      the Cabal, were to be disused, and that the King would adopt no measure
      till it had been discussed and approved by a body, of which one half
      consisted of independent gentlemen and noblemen, and in which such persons
      as Russell, Cavendish, and Temple himself had seats. Town and country were
      in a ferment of joy. The bells were rung; bonfires were lighted; and the
      acclamations of England were echoed by the Dutch, who considered the
      influence obtained by Temple as a certain <span class="pagenum">80</span><a
      name="link80" id="link80"></a>omen of good for Europe. It is, indeed, much
      to the honour of his sagacity that every one of his great measures should,
      in such times, have pleased every party which he had any interest in
      pleasing. This was the case with the Triple Alliance, with the treaty
      which concluded the second Dutch war, with the marriage of the Prince of
      Orange, and, finally, with the institution of this new Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only people who grumbled were those popular, leaders of the House of
      Commons who were not among the Thirty; and, if our view of the measure be
      correct, they were precisely the people who had good reason to grumble.
      They were precisely the people whose activity and whose influence the new
      Council was intended to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was very soon an end of the bright hopes and loud applauses with
      which the publication of this scheme had been hailed. The perfidious
      levity of the King and the ambition of the chiefs of parties produced the
      instant, entire, and irremediable failure of a plan which nothing but
      firmness, public spirit, and self-denial, on the part of all concerned in
      it could conduct to a happy issue. Even before the project was divulged,
      its author had already found reason to apprehend that it would fail.
      Considerable difficulty was experienced in framing the list of
      counsellors. There were two men in particular about whom the King and
      Temple could not agree, two men deeply tainted with the vices common to
      the English statesmen of that age, but unrivalled in talents, address, and
      influence. These were the Earl of Shaftesbury, and George Savile Viscount
      Halifax.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a favourite exercise among the Greek sophists to write panegyrics
      on characters proverbial for depravity. <span class="pagenum">81</span><a
      name="link81" id="link81"></a>One professor of rhetoric sent to Isocrates
      a panegyric on Busiris; and Isocrates himself wrote another, which has
      come down to us. It is, we presume, from an ambition of the same kind that
      some writers have lately shown a disposition to eulogize Shaftesbury. But
      the attempt is vain. The charges against him rest on evidence not to be
      invalidated by any arguments which human wit can devise, or by any
      information which may be found in old trunks and escrutoires.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that, just before the Restoration, he declared to the
      Regicides that he would be damned, body and soul, rather than suffer a
      hair of their heads to be hurt, and that, just after the Restoration he
      was one of the judges who sentenced them to death. It is certain that he
      was a principal member of the most profligate Administration ever known,
      and that he was afterwards a principal member of the most profligate
      Opposition ever known. It is certain that, in power, he did not scruple to
      violate the great fundamental principle of the Constitution, in order to
      exalt the Catholics, and that, out of power, he did not scruple to violate
      every principle of justice, in order to destroy them. There were in that
      age some honest men, such as William Penn, who valued toleration so highly
      that they would willingly have seen it established even by an illegal
      exertion of the prerogative. There were many honest men who dreaded
      arbitrary power so much that, on account of the alliance between Popery
      and arbitrary power, they were disposed to grant no toleration to Papists.
      On both these classes we look with indulgence, though we think both in the
      wrong. But Shaftesbury belonged to neither class. He united all that was
      worst in both. From the misguided <span class="pagenum">82</span><a
      name="link82" id="link82"></a>friends of toleration he borrowed their
      contempt for the Constitution, and from the misguided friends of civil
      liberty their contempt for the rights of conscience. We never can admit
      that his conduct as a member of the Cabal was redeemed by his conduct as a
      leader of Opposition. On the contrary, his life was such that every part
      of it, as if by a skilful contrivance, reflects infamy on every other. We
      should never have known how abandoned a prostitute he was in place, if we
      had not known how desperate an incendiary he was out of it. To judge of
      him fairly, we must bear in mind that the Shaftesbury who, in office, was
      the chief author of the Declaration of Indulgence, was the same
      Shaftesbury who, out of office, excited and kept up the savage hatred of
      the rabble of London against the very class to whom that Declaration of
      Indulgence was intended to give illegal relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is amusing to see the excuses that are made for him. We will give two
      specimens. It is acknowledged that he was one of the Ministry who made the
      alliance with France against Holland, and that this alliance was most
      pernicious. What, then, is the defence? Even this, that he betrayed his
      master&rsquo;s counsels to the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, and tried to
      rouse all the Protestant powers of Germany to defend the States. Again, it
      is acknowledged that he was deeply concerned in the Declaration of
      Indulgence, and that his conduct on this occasion was not only
      unconstitutional, but quite inconsistent with the course which he
      afterwards took respecting the professors of the Catholic faith. What,
      then, is the defence? Even this, that he meant only-to allure concealed
      Papists to avow themselves, and thus to become open marks for the
      vengeance of the public. As often as he is charged <span class="pagenum">83</span><a
      name="link83" id="link83"></a>with one treason, his advocates vindicate
      him by confessing two. They had better leave him where they find him. For
      him there is no escape upwards. Every outlet by which he can creep out of
      his present position, is one which lets him down into a still lower and
      fouler depth of infamy. To whitewash an Ethiopian is a proverbially
      hopeless attempt; but to whitewash an Ethiopian by giving him a new coat
      of blacking, is an enterprise more extraordinary still. That in the course
      of Shaftesbury&rsquo;s dishonest and revengeful opposition to the Court, he
      rendered one or two most useful services to his country we admit. And he
      is, we think, fairly entitled, if that be any glory, to have his name
      eternally associated with the Habeas Corpus Act in the same way in which
      the name of Henry the Eighth is associated with the reformation of the
      Church, and that of Jack Wilkes with the most sacred rights of electors.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Shaftesbury was still living, his character was elaborately drawn by
      two of the greatest writers of the age, by Butler, with characteristic
      brilliancy of wit, by Dryden, with even more than characteristic energy
      and loftiness, by both with all the inspiration of hatred. The sparkling
      illustrations of Butler have been thrown into the shade by the brighter
      glory of that gorgeous satiric Muse, who comes sweeping by in sceptred
      pall, borrowed from her more august sisters. But the descriptions well
      deserve to be compared. The reader will at once perceive a considerable
      difference between Butler&rsquo;s <br /><br /><span class="indent30">&ldquo;politician,
      <br /><span class="indent20">With more heads than a heart in vision.&rdquo;
       </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      and the Ahithophel of Dryden. Butler dwells on Shaftesbury&rsquo;s unprincipled
      versatility on his wonderful <span class="pagenum">84</span><a
      name="link84" id="link84"></a>and almost instinctive skill in discerning
      the approach of a change of fortune; and on the dexterity with which he
      extricated himself from the snares in which he left his associates to
      perish. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;Our state-artificer foresaw

      In Dryden&rsquo;s great portrait, on the contrary, violent passion, implacable
      revenge, boldness amounting to temerity, are the most striking features.
      Ahithophel is one of the &ldquo;great wits to madness near allied.&rdquo; And again&mdash;

     (1) It has never, we believe, been remarked, that two of the
     most striking lines in the description of Ahithophel are
     borrowed from a most obscure quarter. In Knolles&rsquo;s History
     of the Turks, printed more than sixty years before the
     appearance of Absalom and Ahithophel, are the following
     verses, under a portrait of the Sultan Mustapha the First:=

     The circumstance is the more remarkable, because Drvden has
     really no couplet which would seem to a good critic more
     intensely Drydenian, both in thought and expression, than
     this, of which the whole thought, and almost the whole
     expression, are stolen.

     As we are on this subject, we cannot refrain from observing
     that Mr. Courtenay has done Drvden injustice, by
     inadvertently attributing to him some feeble lines which are
     in Tate&rsquo;s part of Absalom and Ahithophel.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">85</span><a name="link85" id="link85"></a>The dates
      of the two poems will, we think, explain this discrepancy. The third part
      of Hudibras appeared in 1678, when the character of Shaftesbury had as yet
      but imperfectly developed itself. He had, indeed, been a traitor to every
      party in the State; but his treasons had hitherto prospered. Whether it
      were accident or sagacity, he had timed his desertions in such a manner
      that fortune seemed to go to and fro with him from side to side. The
      extent of his perfidy was known; but it was not till the Popish Plot
      furnished him with a machinery which seemed sufficiently powerful for all
      his purposes, that the audacity of his spirit, and the fierceness of his
      malevolent passions, became fully manifest. His subsequent conduct showed
      undoubtedly great ability, but not ability of the sort for which he had
      formerly been so eminent. He was now headstrong, sanguine, full of
      impetuous confidence in his own wisdom and his own good luck. He, whose
      fame as a political tactician had hitherto rested chiefly on his skilful
      retreats, now set himself to break down all the bridges behind him. His
      plans were castles in the air: his talk was rodomontade. He took no
      thought for the morrow: he treated the Court as if the King were already a
      prisoner in his hands: he built on the favour of the multitude, as if that
      favour were not proverbially inconstant. The signs of the coming reaction
      were discerned by men of far less sagacity than his, and scared from his
      side men more consistent than he had ever pretended to be. But on him they
      were <span class="pagenum">86</span><a name="link86" id="link86"></a>lost.
      The counsel of Ahithopliel, that counsel which was as if a man had
      inquired of the oracle of God, was turned into foolishness. He who had
      become a byword, for the certainty with which he foresaw and the
      suppleness with which he evaded danger, now, when beset on every side with
      snares and death, seemed to be smitten with a blindness as strange as his
      former clear-sightedness, and, turning neither to the right nor to the
      left, strode straight on with desperate hardihood to his doom. Therefore,
      after having early acquired and long preserved the reputation of
      infallible wisdom and invariable success, he lived to see a mighty ruin
      wrought by his own ungovernable passions, to see the great party which he
      had led vanquished, and scattered, and trampled down, to see all his own
      devilish enginery of lying witnesses, partial sheriffs, packed juries,
      unjust judges, bloodthirsty mobs, ready to be employed against himself and
      his most devoted followers, to fly from that proud city whose favour had
      almost raised him to be Mayor of the Palace, to hide himself in squalid
      retreats, to cover his grey head with ignominious disguises; and he died
      in hopeless exile, sheltered, by the generosity of a State which he had
      cruelly injured and insulted, from the vengeance of a master whose favour
      he had purchased by one series of crimes, and forfeited by another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halifax had, in common with Shaftesbury, and with almost all the
      politicians of that age, a very loose morality where the public was
      concerned; but in Halifax the prevailing infection was modified by a very
      peculiar constitution both of heart and head, by a temper singularly free
      from gall, and by a refining and sceptical understanding. He changed his
      course as often as Shaftesbury; but he did not change it to the same <span
      class="pagenum">87</span><a name="link87" id="link87"></a>extent, or in
      the same direction. Shaftesbury was the very reverse of a trimmer. His
      disposition led him generally to do his utmost to exalt the side which was
      up, and to depress the side which was down. His transitions were from
      extreme to extreme. While he stayed with a party he went all lengths for
      it: when he quitted it he went all lengths against it. Halifax was
      emphatically a trimmer; a trimmer both by intellect and by constitution.
      The name was fixed on him by his contemporaries; and he was so far from
      being ashamed of it that he assumed it as a badge of honour. He passed
      from faction to faction. But, instead of adopting and inflaming the
      passions of those whom he joined, he tried to diffuse among them something
      of the spirit of those whom he had just left. While he acted with the
      Opposition he was suspected of being a spy of the Court; and when he had
      joined the Court all the Tories were dismayed by his Republican doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted neither arguments nor eloquence to exhibit what was commonly
      regarded as his wavering policy in the fairest light. He trimmed, he said,
      as the temperate zone trims between intolerable heat and intolerable cold,
      as a good government trims between despotism and anarchy, as a pure church
      trims between the errors of the Papist and those of the Anabaptist. Nor
      was this defence by any means without weight; for, though there is
      abundant proof that his integrity was not of strength to withstand the
      temptations by which his cupidity and vanity were sometimes assailed, yet
      his dislike of extremes, and a forgiving and compassionate temper which
      seems to have been natural to him, preserved him from all participation in
      the worst crimes of his time. If both parties accused him of deserting
      <span class="pagenum">88</span><a name="link88" id="link88"></a>them, both
      were compelled to admit that they had great obligations to his humanity,
      and that, though an uncertain friend, he was a placable enemy. He voted in
      favour of Lord Stafford, the victim of the Whigs; he did his utmost to
      save Lord Russell, the victim of the Tories; and, on the whole, we are
      inclined to think that his public life, though far indeed from faultless,
      has as few great stains as that of any politician who took an active part
      in affairs during the troubled and disastrous period of ten years which
      elapsed between the fall of Lord Danby and the Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was much less turned to particular observations, and much more to
      general speculations, than that of Shaftesbury. Shaftesbury knew the King,
      the Council, the Parliament, the city, better than Halifax; but Halifax
      would have written a far better treatise on political science than
      Shaftesbury. Shaftesbury shone more in consultation, and Halifax in
      controversy: Shaftesbury was more fertile in expedients, and Halifax in
      arguments. Nothing that remains from the pen of Shaftesbury will bear a
      comparison with the political tracts of Halifax. Indeed, very little of
      the prose of that age is so well worth reading as the Character of a
      Trimmer and the Anatomy of an Equivalent. What particularly strikes us in
      those works is the writer&rsquo;s passion for generalisation. He was treating of
      the most exciting subjects in the most agitated times: he was himself
      placed in the very thick of the civil conflict; yet there is no acrimony,
      nothing inflammatory, nothing personal. He preserves an air of cold
      superiority, a certain philosophical serenity, which is perfectly
      marvellous. He treats every question as an abstract question, begins with
      the widest propositions, argues those propositions on general grounds, and
      often, when he has <span class="pagenum">89</span><a name="link89"
       id="link89"></a>brought out his theorem, leaves the reader to make tie
      application, without adding an allusion to particular men or to passing
      events. This speculative turn of mind rendered him a bad adviser in cases
      which required celerity. He brought forward, with wonderful readiness and
      copiousness, arguments, replies to those arguments, rejoinders to those
      replies, general maxims of policy, and analogous cases from history. But
      Shaftesbury was the man for a prompt decision. Of the parliamentary
      eloquence of these celebrated rivals, we can judge only by report; and, so
      judging, we should be inclined to think that, though Shaftesbury was a
      distinguished speaker, the superiority belonged to Halifax. Indeed the
      readiness of Halifax in debate, the extent of his knowledge, the ingenuity
      of his reasoning, the liveliness of his expression, and the silver
      clearness and sweetness of his voice, seem to have made the strongest
      impression on his contemporaries. By Dryden he is described as <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">&ldquo;of piercing wit and pregnant thought, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Endued by nature and by learning taught <br /><span
      class="indent15">To move assemblies.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His oratory is utterly and irretrievably lost to us, like that of Somers,
      of Bolingbroke, of Charles Townshend, of many others who were accustomed
      to rise amidst the breathless expectation of senates, and to sit down
      amidst reiterated bursts of applause. But old men who lived to admire the
      eloquence of Pulteney in its meridian, and that of Pitt in its splendid
      dawn, still murmured that they had heard nothing like the great speeches
      of Lord Halifax on the Exclusion Bill. The power of Shaftesbury over large
      masses was unrivalled. Halifax was disqualified by his whole character,
      moral and intellectual, for the part of a demagogue. It was in small <span
      class="pagenum">90</span><a name="link90" id="link90"></a>circles, and,
      above all, in the House of Lords, that his ascendency was felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaftesbury seems to have troubled himself very little about theories of
      government. Halifax was, in speculation, a strong republican, and did not
      conceal it. He often made hereditary monarchy and aristocracy the subjects
      of his keen pleasantry, while he was fighting the battles of the Court,
      and obtaining for himself step after step in the peerage. In this way, he
      tried to gratify at once his intellectual vanity and his more vulgar
      ambition. He shaped his life according to the opinion of the multitude,
      and indemnified himself by talking according to his own. His colloquial
      powers were great; his perception of the ridiculous exquisitely fine; and
      he seems to have had the rare art of preserving the reputation of good
      breeding and good nature, while habitually indulging a strong propensity
      to mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple wished to put Halifax into the new council, and to leave out
      Shaftesbury. The King objected strongly to Halifax, to whom he had taken a
      great dislike, which is not accounted for, and which did not last long.
      Temple replied that Halifax was a man eminent both by his station and by
      his abilities, and would, if excluded, do every thing against the new
      arrangement that could be done by eloquence, sarcasm, and intrigue. All
      who were consulted were of the same mind; and the King yielded, but not
      till Temple had almost gone on his knees. This point was no sooner settled
      than his Majesty declared that he would have Shaftesbury too. Temple again
      had recourse to entreaties and expostulations. Charles told him that the
      enmity of Shaftesbury would be at least as formidable as that of Halifax;
      and this was true; but <span class="pagenum">91</span><a name="link91"
       id="link91"></a>Temple might have replied that by giving power to Halifax
      they gained a friend, and that by giving power to Shaftesbury, they only
      strengthened an enemy. It was vain to argue and protest. The King only
      laughed and jested at Temple&rsquo;s anger; and Shaftesbury was not only sworn
      of the Council, but appointed Lord President.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was so bitterly mortified by this step that he had at one time
      resolved to have nothing to do with the new Administration, and seriously
      thought of disqualifying himself from sitting in council by omitting to
      take the Sacrament. But the urgency of Lady Temple and Lady Giffard
      induced him to abandon that intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council was organized on the twenty-first of April, 1679; and, within
      a few hours, one of the fundamental principles on which it had been
      constructed was violated. A secret committee, or, in the modern phrase, a
      cabinet of nine members, was formed. But, as this committee included
      Shaftesbury and Monmouth, it contained within itself the elements of as
      much faction as would have sufficed to impede all business. Accordingly
      there soon arose a small interior cabinet, consisting of Essex,
      Sunderland, Halifax, and Temple. For a time perfect harmony and confidence
      subsisted between the four. But the meetings of the thirty were stormy.
      Sharp retorts passed between Shaftesbury and Halifax, who led the opposite
      parties. In the Council Halifax generally had the advantage. But it soon
      became apparent that Shaftesbury still had at his back the majority of the
      House of Commons. The discontents which the change of Ministry had for a
      moment quieted broke forth again with redoubled violence; and the only
      effect which the late measures <span class="pagenum">92</span><a
      name="link92" id="link92"></a>appeared to have produced was that the Lord
      President, with all the dignity and authority belonging to his high place,
      stood at the head of the Opposition. The impeachment of Lord Danby was
      eagerly prosecuted. The Commons were determined to exclude the Duke of
      York from the throne. All offers of compromise were rejected. It must not
      be forgotten, however, that, in the midst of the confusion, one
      inestimable law, the only benefit which England has derived from the
      troubles of that period, but a benefit which may well be set off against a
      great mass of evil, the Habeas Corpus Act, was pushed through the Houses
      and received the royal assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, finding the Parliament as troublesome as ever, determined to
      prorogue it; and he did so without even mentioning his intention to the
      Council by whose advice he had pledged himself, only a month before, to
      conduct the Government. The counsellors were generally dissatisfied; and
      Shaftesbury swore with great vehemence, that, if he could find out who the
      secret advisers were, he would have their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament rose; London was deserted; and Temple retired to his villa,
      whence, on council days, he went to Hampton Court. The post of Secretary
      was again and again pressed on him by his master and by his three
      colleagues of the inner Cabinet. Halifax, in particular, threatened
      laughingly to burn down the house at Sheen. But Temple was immovable. His
      short experience of English politics had disgusted him; and he felt
      himself so much oppressed by the responsibility under which he at present
      lay that he had no inclination to add to the load.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the term fixed for the prorogation had nearly expired, it became
      necessary to consider what course <span class="pagenum">93</span><a
      name="link93" id="link93"></a>should be taken. The King and his four
      confidential advisers thought that a new Parliament might possibly be more
      manageable, and could not possibly be more refractory, than that which
      they now had, and they therefore determined on a dissolution. But when the
      question was proposed at council, the majority, jealous, it should seem,
      of the small directing knot, and unwilling to bear the unpopularity of the
      measures of Government, while excluded from all power, joined Shaftesbury,
      and the members of the Cabinet were left; alone in the minority. The King,
      however, had made up his mind, and ordered the Parliament to be instantly
      dissolved. Temple&rsquo;s council was now nothing more than an ordinary privy
      council, if indeed it were not something less; and, though Temple threw
      the blame of this on the King, on Lord Shaftesbury, on everybody but
      himself, it is evident that the failure of his plan is to be chiefly
      ascribed to its own inherent defects. His council was too large to
      transact business which required expedition, secrecy, and cordial
      co-operation. A Cabinet was therefore formed within the Council. The
      Cabinet and the majority of the Council differed; and, as was to be
      expected, the Cabinet carried their point. Four votes outweighed
      six-and-twenty. This being the case, the meetings of the thirty were not
      only useless, but positively noxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the ensuing election, Temple was chosen for the university of
      Cambridge. The only objection that was made to him by the members of that
      learned body was that, in his little work on Holland, he had expressed
      great approbation of the tolerant policy of the States; and this blemish,
      however serious, was overlooked, in consideration of his high reputation,
      and of the strong recommendations with which he was furnished by the
      Court. <span class="pagenum">94</span><a name="link94" id="link94"></a>During
      the summer he remained at Sheen, and amused himself with rearing melons,
      leaving to the three other members of the inner Cabinet the whole
      direction of public affairs. Some unexplained cause began, about this
      time, to alienate them from him. They do not appear to have been made
      angry by any part of his conduct, or to have disliked him personally. But
      they had, we suspect, taken the measure of his mind, and satisfied
      themselves that he was not a man for that troubled time, and that he would
      be a mere incumbrance to them. Living themselves for ambition, they
      despised his love of ease. Accustomed to deep stakes in the game of
      political hazard, they despised his piddling play. They looked on his
      cautious measures with the sort of scorn with which the gamblers at the
      ordinary, in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel, regarded Nigel&rsquo;s practice of never
      touching a card but when he was certain to win. He soon found that he was
      left out of their secrets. The King had, about this time, a dangerous
      attack of illness. The Duke of York, on receiving the news, returned from
      Holland. The sudden appearance of the detested Popish successor excited
      anxiety throughout the country. Temple was greatly amazed and disturbed.
      He hastened up to London and visited Essex, who professed to be astonished
      and mortified, but could not disguise a sneering smile. Temple then saw
      Halifax, who talked to him much about the pleasures of the country, the
      anxieties of office, and the vanity of all human things, but carefully
      avoided politics, and when the Duke&rsquo;s return was mentioned, only sighed,
      shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and lifted up his eyes and hands.
      In a short time Temple found that his two friends had been laughing at
      him, and that they had <span class="pagenum">95</span><a name="link95"
       id="link95"></a>themselves sent for the Duke, in order that his Royal
      Highness might, if the King should die, be on the spot to frustrate the
      designs of Monmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon convinced, by a still stronger proof, that, though he had not
      exactly offended his master or his colleagues in the Cabinet, he had
      ceased to enjoy their confidence. The result of the general election had
      been decidedly unfavourable to the Government; and Shaftesbury impatiently
      expected the day when the Houses were to meet. The King, guided by the
      advice of the inner Cabinet, determined on a step of the highest
      importance. He told the Council that he had resolved to prorogue the new
      Parliament for a year, and requested them not to object; for he had, he
      said, considered the subject fully, and had made up his mind. All who were
      not in the secret were thunderstruck, Temple as much as any. Several
      members rose, and entreated to be heard against the prorogation. But the
      King silenced them, and declared that his resolution was unalterable.
      Temple, much hurt at the manner in which both himself and the Council had
      been treated, spoke with great spirit. He would not, he said, disobey the
      King by objecting to a measure on which his Majesty was determined to hear
      no argument; but he would most earnestly entreat his Majesty, if the
      present Council was incompetent to give advice, to dissolve it and select
      another; for it was absurd to have counsellors who did not counsel, and
      who were summoned only to be silent witnesses of the acts, of others. The
      King listened courteously. But the members of the Cabinet resented this
      reproof highly; and from that day Temple was almost as much estranged from
      them as from Shaftesbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished to retire altogether from business. But <span class="pagenum">96</span><a
      name="link96" id="link96"></a>just at this time Lord Russell, Lord
      Cavendish, and some other counsellors of the popular party, waited on the
      King in a body, declared their strong disapprobation of his measures, and
      requested to be excused from attending any more at council. Temple feared
      that if, at this moment, he also were to withdraw, he might be supposed to
      act in concert with those decided opponents of the Court, and to have
      determined on taking a course hostile to the Government. He, therefore,
      continued to go occasionally to the board; but he had no longer any real
      share in the direction of public affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the long term of the prorogation expired. In October, 1680, the
      Houses met; and the great question of the Exclusion was revived. Few
      parliamentary contests in our history appear to have called forth a
      greater display of talent; none certainly ever called forth more violent
      passions. The whole nation was convulsed by party spirit. The gentlemen of
      every county, the traders of every town, the boys of every public school,
      were divided into exclusionists and abhorrers. The book-stalls were
      covered with tracts on the sacredness of hereditary right, on the
      omnipotence of Parliament, on the dangers of a disputed succession, on the
      dangers of a Popish reign. It was in the midst of this ferment that Temple
      took his seat, for the first time, in the House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was a very great one. His talents, his long experience of
      affairs, his unspotted public character, the high posts which he had
      filled, seemed to mark him out as a man on whom much would depend. He
      acted like himself. He saw that, if he supported the Exclusion, he made
      the King and the heir presumptive his enemies, and that, if he opposed
      <span class="pagenum">97</span><a name="link97" id="link97"></a>it, he
      made himself an object of hatred to the unscrupulous and turbulent
      Shaftesbury. He neither supported nor opposed it. He quietly absented
      himself from the House. Nay, he took care, he tells us, never to discuss
      the question in any society whatever. Lawrence Hyde, afterwards Earl of
      Rochester, asked him why he did not attend in his place. Temple replied
      that he acted according to Solomon&rsquo;s advice, neither to oppose the mighty,
      nor to go about to stop the current of a river. Hyde answered, &ldquo;You are a
      wise and a quiet man.&rdquo; And this might be true. But surely such wise and
      quiet men have no call to be members of Parliament in critical times.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single session was quite enough for Temple. When the Parliament was
      dissolved, and another summoned at Oxford, he obtained an audience of the
      King, and begged to know whether his Majesty wished him to continue in
      Parliament. Charles, who had a singularly quick eye for the weaknesses of
      all who came near him, had no doubt seen through Temple, and rated the
      parliamentary support of so cool and guarded a friend at its proper value.
      He answered good-naturedly, but we suspect a little contemptuously, &ldquo;I
      doubt, as things stand, your coming into the House will not do much good.
      I think you may as well let it alone.&rdquo; Sir William accordingly informed
      his constituents that he should not again apply for their suffrages, and
      set off for Sheen, resolving never again to meddle with public affairs. He
      soon found that the King was displeased with him. Charles, indeed, in his
      usual easy way, protested that he was not angry, not at all. But in a few
      days he struck Temple&rsquo;s name out of the list of Privy Counsellors. Why
      this was done Temple declares himself <span class="pagenum">98</span><a
      name="link98" id="link98"></a>unable to comprehend. But surely it hardly
      required his long and extensive converse with the world to teach him that
      there are conjunctures when men think that all who are not with them are
      against them, that there are conjunctures when a lukewarm friend, who will
      not put himself the least out of his way, who will make no exertion, who
      will run no risk, is more distasteful than an enemy. Charles had hoped
      that the fair character of Temple would add credit to an unpopular and
      suspected Government. But his Majesty soon found that this fair character
      resembled pieces of furniture which we have seen in the drawing-rooms of
      very precise old ladies, and which are a great deal too white to be used.
      This exceeding niceness was altogether out of season. Neither party wanted
      a man who was afraid of taking a part, of incurring abuse, of making
      enemies. There were probably many good and moderate men who would have
      hailed the appearance of a respectable mediator. But Temple was not a
      mediator. He was merely a neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, he had escaped from public life, and found himself at
      liberty to follow his favourite pursuits. His fortune was easy. He had
      about fifteen hundred a year, besides the Mastership of the Rolls in
      Ireland, an office in which he had succeeded his father, and which was
      then a mere sinecure for life, requiring no residence. His reputation both
      as a negotiator and a writer stood high. He resolved to be safe, to enjoy
      himself, and to let the world take its course; and he kept his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darker times followed. The Oxford Parliament was dissolved. The Tories
      were triumphant. A terrible vengeance was inflicted on the chiefs of the
      Opposition. Temple learned in his retreat the disastrous fate of several
      <span class="pagenum">99</span><a name="link99" id="link99"></a>of his old
      colleagues in council. Shaftesbury fled to Holland. Russell died on the
      scaffold. Essex added a yet sadder and more fearful story to the bloody
      chronicles of the Tower. Monmouth clung in agonies of supplication round
      the knees of the stern uncle whom he had wronged, and tasted a bitterness
      worse than that of death, the bitterness of knowing that he had humbled
      himself in vain. A tyrant trampled on the liberties and religion of the
      realm. The national spirit swelled high under the oppression. Disaffection
      spread even to the strongholds of loyalty, to the cloisters of
      Westminster, to the schools of Oxford, to the guardroom of the household
      troops, to the very hearth and bed-chamber of the Sovereign. But the
      troubles which agitated the whole country did not reach the quiet Orangery
      in which Temple loitered away several years without once seeing the smoke
      of London. He now and then appeared in the circle at Richmond or Windsor.
      But the only expressions which he is recorded to have used during these
      perilous times were, that he would be a good subject, but that he had done
      with politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Revolution came: he remained strictly neutral during the short
      struggle; and he then transferred to the new settlement the same languid
      sort of loyalty which he had felt for his former masters. He paid court to
      William at Windsor, and William dined with him at Sheen. But, in spite of
      the most pressing solicitations, Temple refused to become Secretary of
      State. The refusal evidently proceeded only from his dislike of trouble
      and danger; and not, as some of his admirers would have us believe, from
      any scruple of conscience or honour. For he consented that his son should
      take the office of Secretary at War under the new Sovereign. <span
      class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>This
      unfortunate young man destroyed himself within a week after his
      appointment, from vexation at finding that his advice had led the King
      into some improper steps with regard to Ireland. He seems to have
      inherited his father&rsquo;s extreme sensibility to failure, without that
      singular prudence which kept his father out of all situations in which any
      serious failure was to be apprehended. The blow fell heavily on the
      family. They retired in deep dejection to Moor Park, which they now
      preferred to Sheen, on account of the greater distance from London. In
      that spot, (1) then very secluded, Temple passed the remainder of his
      life. The air agreed with him. The soil was fruitful, and well suited to
      an experimental farmer and gardener. The grounds were laid out with the
      angular regularity which Sir William had admired in the flower-beds of
      Haarlem and the Hague. A beautiful rivulet, flowing from the hills of
      Surrey, bounded the domain. But a straight canal which, bordered by a
      terrace, intersected the gar-. den, was probably more admired by the
      lovers of the picturesque in that age. The house was small, but neat and
      well furnished; the neighbourhood very thinly peopled. Temple had no
      visitors, except a few friends who were willing to travel twenty or thirty
      miles in order to see him, and now and then a foreigner whom curiosity
      brought to have a look at the author of the Triple Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in May, 1694, died Lady Temple. From the time of her marriage we
      know little of her, except that her letters were always greatly admired,
      and that she had the honour to correspond constantly with Queen

     (1) Mr. Courtenay (vol ii p. 160.) confounds Moor Park in
     Surrey, where Temple resided, with the Moor Park in
     Hertfordshire, which is praised in the Essay on Gardening.

      Lady Giffard, who, as far as appears, had always been on the best terms
      with her sister-in-law, still continued to live with Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other inmates of Moor Park to whom a far higher interest
      belongs. An eccentric, uncouth, disagreeable young Irishman, who had
      narrowly escaped plucking at Dublin, attended Sir William as an
      amanuensis, for board and twenty pounds a year, dined at the second table,
      wrote bad verses in praise of his employer, and made love to a very
      pretty, dark-eyed young girl, who waited on Lady Giffard. Little did
      Temple imagine that the coarse exterior of his dependent concealed a
      genius equally suited to politics and to letters, a genius destined to
      shake great kingdoms, to stir the laughter and the rage of millions, and
      to leave to posterity memorials which can perish only with the English
      language. Little did he think that the flirtation in his servants&rsquo; hall,
      which he perhaps scarcely deigned to make the subject of a jest, was the
      beginning of a long unprosperous love, which was to be as widely famed as
      the passion of Petrarch or of Abelard. Sir William&rsquo;s secretary was
      Jonathan Swift. Lady Gif-fard&rsquo;s waiting maid was poor Stella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift retained no pleasing recollection of Moor Park. And we may easily
      suppose a situation like his to have been intolerably painful to a mind
      haughty, irascible, and conscious of preeminent ability. Long after, when
      he stood in the Court of Requests with a circle of gartered peers round
      him, or punned and rhymed with Cabinet Ministers over Secretary St. John&rsquo;s
      Monte-Pulciano, he remembered, with deep and sore feeling, how miserable
      he used to be for days together when he suspected that Sir William had
      taken something ill. He could hardly believe that he, the Swift who chid
      the Lord <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>Treasurer,
      rallied the Captain General, and confronted the pride of the Duke of
      Buckinghamshire with pride still more inflexible, could be the same being
      who had passed nights of sleepless anxiety, in musing over a cross look or
      a testy word of a patron. &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; he wrote to Stella, with bitter levity,
      &ldquo;Sir William spoiled a fine gentleman.&rdquo; Yet, in justice to Temple, we must
      say that there is no reason to think that Swift was more unhappy at Moor
      Park than he would have been in a similar situation under any roof in
      England. We think also that the obligations which the mind of Swift owed
      to that of Temple were not inconsiderable. Every judicious reader must be
      struck by the peculiarities which distinguish Swift&rsquo;s political tracts
      from all similar works produced by mere men of letters. Let any person
      compare, for example, the Conduct of the Allies, or the Letter to the
      October Club, with Johnson&rsquo;s False Alarm, or Taxation no Tyranny, and he
      will be at once struck by the difference of which we speak. He may
      possibly think Johnson a greater man than Swift. He may possibly prefer
      Johnson&rsquo;s style to Swift&rsquo;s. But he will at once acknowledge that Johnson
      writes like a man who has never been out of his study. Swift writes like a
      man who has passed his whole life in the midst of public business, and to
      whom the most important affairs of state are as familiar as his weekly
      bills. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;Turn him to any cause of policy,
      <br /><span class="indent20">The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Familiar as his garter.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference, in short, between a political pamphlet by Johnson, and a
      political pamphlet by Swift, is as great as the difference between an
      account of a battle by Mr. Southey and the account of the same battle by
      <span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>Colonel
      Napier. It is impossible to doubt that the superiority of Swift is to be,
      in a great measure, attributed to his long and close connection with
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, remote as were the alleys and flower-pots of Moor Park from the
      haunts of the busy and the ambitious, Swift had ample opportunities of
      becoming acquainted with the hidden causes of many great events. William
      was in the habit of consulting Temple, and occasionally visited him. Of
      what passed between them very little is known. It is certain, however,
      that when the Triennial Bill had been carried through the two Houses, his
      Majesty, who was exceedingly unwilling to pass it, sent the Earl of
      Portland to learn Temple&rsquo;s opinion. Whether Temple thought the bill in
      itself a good one does not appear; but he clearly saw how imprudent it
      must be in a prince, situated as William was, to engage in an altercation
      with his Parliament, and directed Swift to draw up a paper on the subject,
      which, however, did not convince the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief amusement of Temple&rsquo;s declining years was literature. After his
      final retreat from business he wrote his very agreeable Memoirs, corrected
      and transcribed many of his letters, and published several miscellaneous
      treatises, the best of which, we think, is that on Gardening. The style of
      his essays is, on the whole, excellent, almost always pleasing, and now
      and then stately and splendid. The matter is generally of much less value;
      as our readers will readily believe when we inform them that Mr.
      Courtenay, a biographer, that is to say, a literary vassal, bound by the
      immemorial law of his tenure to render homage, aids, reliefs, and all
      other customary services to his lord, avows that he cannot give an opinion
      about the essay on Heroic Virtue, because he cannot read it without <span
      class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>skipping; a
      circumstance which strikes us as peculiarly strange, when we consider how
      long Mr. Courtenay was at the India Board, and how many thousand
      paragraphs of the copious official eloquence of the East he must have
      perused.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Sir William&rsquo;s pieces, however, deserves notice, not, indeed, on
      account of its intrinsic merit, but on account of the light which it
      throws on some curious weaknesses of his character, and on account of the
      extraordinary effects which it produced in the republic of letters. A most
      idle and contemptible controversy had arisen in France touching the
      comparative merit of the ancient and modern writers. It was certainly not
      to be expected that, in that age, the question would be tried according to
      those large and philosophical principles of criticism which guided the
      judgments of Lessing and of Herder. But it might have been expected that
      those who undertook to decide the point would at least take the trouble to
      read and understand the authors on whose merits they were to pronounce.
      Now it is no exaggeration to say that, among the disputants who clamoured,
      some for the ancients and some for the moderns, very few were decently
      acquainted with either ancient or modern literature, and hardly one was
      well acquainted with both. In Racine&rsquo;s amusing preface to the <i>Iphigénie</i>
      the reader may find noticed a most ridiculous mistake into which one cf
      the champions of the moderns fell about a passage in the Alcestis of
      Euripides. Another writer is so inconceivably ignorant as to blame Homer
      for mixing the four Greek dialects, Doric, Ionic, Æolic, and Attic, just,
      says he, as if a French poet were to put Gascon phrases and Picard phrases
      into the midst of his pure Parisian writing. On the other hand, it is no
      <span class="pagenum">105</span><a name="link105" id="link105"></a>exaggeration
      to say that the defenders of the ancients were entirely unacquainted with
      the greatest productions of later times; nor, indeed, were the defenders
      of the moderns better informed. The parallels which were instituted in the
      course of this dispute are inexpressibly ridiculous. Balzac was selected
      as the rival of Cicero. Corneille was said to unite the merits of
      Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. We should like to see a Prometheus
      after Corneille&rsquo;s fashion. The Provincial Letters, masterpieces
      undoubtedly of reasoning, wit, and eloquence, were pronounced to be
      superior to all the writings of Plato, Cicero, and Lucian together,
      particularly in the art of dialogue, an art in which, as it happens, Plato
      far excelled all men, and in which Pascal, great and admirable in other
      respects, is notoriously very deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      This childish controversy spread to England; and some mischievous dæmon
      suggested to Temple the thought of undertaking the defence of the
      ancients. As to his qualifications for the task, it is sufficient to say,
      that he knew not a word of Greek. But his vanity which, when he was
      engaged in the conflicts of active life and surrounded by rivals, had been
      kept in tolerable order by his discretion, now, when he had long lived in
      seclusion, and had become accustomed to regard himself as by far the first
      man of his circle, rendered him blind to his own deficiencies. In an evil
      hour he published an Essay on Ancient and Modern Learning. The style of
      this treatise is very good, the matter ludicrous and contemptible to the
      last degree. There we read how Lycurgus travelled into India, and brought
      the Spartan laws from that country; how Orpheus made voyages in search of
      knowledge, and attained to a depth of learning which has made him <span
      class="pagenum">106</span><a name="link106" id="link106"></a>renowned in
      all succeeding ages; how Pythagoras passed twenty-two years in Egypt, and,
      after graduating there, spent twelve years more at Babylon, where the Magi
      admitted him <i>ad eundem</i>; how the ancient Brahmins lived two hundred
      years; how the earliest Greek philosophers foretold earthquakes and
      plagues, and put down riots by magic; and how much Ninus surpassed in
      abilities any of his successors on the throne of Assyria. The moderns, Sir
      William owns, have found out the circulation of the blood; but, on the
      other hand, they have quite lost the art of conjuring; nor can any modern
      fiddler enchant fishes, fowls, and serpents, by his performance. He tells
      us that &ldquo;Thales, Pythagoras, Democritus, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle,
      and Epicurus made greater progresses in the several empires of science
      than any of their successors have since been able to reach;&rdquo; which is just
      as absurd as if he had said that the greatest names in British science
      are Merlin, Michael Scott, Dr. Sydenham, and Lord Bacon. Indeed, the
      manner in which Temple mixes the historical and the fabulous reminds us of
      those classical dictionaries, intended for the use of schools, in which
      Narcissus the lover of himself and Narcissus the freedman of Claudius,
      Pollux the son of Jupiter and Leda and Pollux the author of the
      Onomasticon, are ranged under the same headings, and treated as personages
      equally real. The effect of this arrangement resembles that which would be
      produced by a dictionary of modern names, consisting of such articles as
      the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Jones, William, an eminent Orientalist, and one of
      the Judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Bengal&mdash;Davy, a
      fiend, who destroys ships&mdash;Thomas, a foundling, brought up by Mr.
      Allworthy.&rdquo; It is from such sources as these that Temple <span
      class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107" id="link107"></a>seems to have
      learned all that he knew about the ancients. He puts the story of Orpheus
      between the Olympic games and the battle of Arbela; as if we had exactly
      the same reasons for believing that Orpheus led beasts with his lyre,
      which we have for believing that there were races at Pisa, or that
      Alexander conquered Darius.
    </p>
    <p>
      He manages little better when he comes to the moderns. He gives us a
      catalogue of those whom he regards as the greatest writers of later times.
      It is sufficient to say that, in his list of Italians, he has omitted
      Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso; in his list of Spaniards, Lope and
      Calderon; in his list of French, Pascal, Bossuet, Molière, Corneille,
      Racine, and Boileau; and in his list of English, Chaucer, Spenser,
      Shakspeare, and Milton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this vast mass of absurdity one paragraph stands out
      preeminent. The doctrine of Temple, not a very comfortable doctrine, is
      that the human race is constantly degenerating, and that the oldest books
      in every kind are the best. In confirmation of this notion, he remarks
      that the Fables of Æsop are the best Fables, and the letters of Phalaris
      the best Letters in the world. On the merit of the Letters of Phalaris he
      dwells with great warmth and with extraordinary felicity of language.
      Indeed we could hardly select a more favourable specimen of the graceful
      and easy majesty to which his style sometimes rises than this unlucky
      passage. He knows, he says, that some learned men, or men who pass for
      learned, such as Politian, have doubted the genuineness of these letters:
      but of such doubts he speaks with the greatest contempt. Now it is
      perfectly certain, first, that the letters are very bad; secondly, that
      they are spurious; <span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108"
       id="link108"></a>and thirdly, that, whether they be bad or good, spurious
      or genuine, Temple could know nothing of the matter; inasmuch as he was no
      more able to construe a line of them than to decipher an Egyptian obelisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Essay, silly as it is, was exceedingly well received, both in England
      and on the Continent. And the reason is evident. The classical scholars
      who saw its absurdity were generally on the side of the ancients, and were
      inclined rather to veil than to expose the blunders of an ally; the
      champions of the moderns were generally as ignorant as Temple himself; and
      the multitude was charmed by his flowing and melodious diction. He was
      doomed, however, to smart, as he well deserved, for his vanity and folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christchurch at Oxford was then widely and justly celebrated as a place
      where the lighter parts of classical learning were cultivated with
      success. With the deeper mysteries of philology neither the instructors
      nor the pupils had the smallest acquaintance. They fancied themselves
      Scaligers, as Bentley scornfully said, if they could write a copy of Latin
      verses with only two or three small faults. From this College proceeded a
      new edition of the Letters of Phalaris, which were rare, and had been in
      request since the appearance of Temple&rsquo;s Essay. The nominal editor was
      Charles Boyle, a young man of noble family and promising parts; but some
      older members of the society lent their assistance. While this work was in
      preparation, an idle quarrel, occasioned, it should seem, by the
      negligence and misrepresentations of a bookseller, arose between Boyle and
      the King&rsquo;s Librarian, Richard Bentley. Boyle, in the preface to his
      edition, inserted a bitter reflection on Bentley. Bentley revenged himself
      <span class="pagenum">109</span><a name="link109" id="link109"></a>by
      proving that the Epistles of Phalaris were forgeries, and in his remarks
      on this subject treated Temple, not indecently, but with no great
      reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, who was quite unaccustomed to any but the most respectful usage,
      who, even while engaged in politics, had always shrunk from all rude
      collision and had generally succeeded in avoiding it, and whose
      sensitiveness had been increased by many years of seclusion and flattery,
      was moved to most violent resentment, complained, very unjustly, of
      Bentley&rsquo;s foul-mouthed raillery, and declared that he had commenced an
      answer, but had laid it aside, &ldquo;having no mind to enter the lists with
      such a mean, dull, unmannerly pedant.&rdquo; Whatever may be thought of the
      temper which Sir William showed on this occasion, we cannot too highly
      applaud his discretion in not finishing and publishing his answer, which
      would certainly have been a most extraordinary performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not, however, without defenders. Like Hector, when struck down
      prostrate by Ajax, he was in an instant covered by a thick crowd of
      shields.

    <p>
      Christchurch was up in arms; and though that College seems then to have
      been almost destitute of severe and accurate learning, no academical
      society could show a greater array of orators, wits, politicians, bustling
      adventurers who united the superficial accomplishments of the scholar with
      the manners and arts of the man of the world; and this formidable body
      resolved to try how far smart repartees, well-turned sentences, <span
      class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110" id="link110"></a>confidence,
      puffing, and intrigue could, on the question whether a Greek hook were or
      were not genuine, supply the place of a little knowledge of Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out came the Reply to Bentley, bearing the name of Boyle, but in truth
      written by Atterbury with the assistance of Smallridge and others. A most
      remarkable book it is, and often reminds us of Goldsmith&rsquo;s observation,
      that the French would be the best cooks in the world if they had any
      butcher&rsquo;s meat; for that they can make ten dishes out of a nettle-top. It
      really deserves the praise, whatever that praise may be worth, of being
      the best book ever written by any man on the wrong side of a question of
      which he was profoundly ignorant. The learning of the confederacy is that
      of a schoolboy, and not of an extraordinary schoolboy; but it is used with
      the skill and address of most able, artful, and experienced men; it is
      beaten out to the very thinnest leaf, and is disposed in such a way as to
      seem ten times larger than it is. The dexterity with which the
      confederates avoid grappling with those parts of the subject with which
      they know themselves to be incompetent to deal is quite wonderful. Now and
      then, indeed, they commit disgraceful blunders, for which old Busby, under
      whom they had studied, would have whipped them all round. But this
      circumstance only raises our opinion of the talents which made such a
      fight with such scanty means. Let readers who are not acquainted with the
      controversy imagine a Frenchman, who has acquired just English enough to
      read the Spectator with a dictionary, coming forward to defend the
      genuineness of Ireland&rsquo;s Vortigern against Malone; and they will have some
      notion of the feat which Atterbury had the audacity to undertake, and
      which, <span class="pagenum">111</span><a name="link111" id="link111"></a>for
      a time, it was really thought that he had performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illusion was soon dispelled. Bentley&rsquo;s answer for ever settled the
      question, and established his claim to the first place amongst classical
      scholars. Nor do those do him justice who represent the controversy as a
      battle between wit and learning. For though there is a lamentable
      deficiency of learning on the side of Boyle, there is no want of wit on
      the side of Bentley. Other qualities, too, as valuable as either wit or
      learning, appear conspicuously in Bentley&rsquo;s book, a rare sagacity, an
      unrivalled power of combination, a perfect mastery of all the weapons of
      logic. He was greatly indebted to the furious outcry which the
      misrepresentations, sarcasms, and intrigues of his opponents had raised
      against him, an outcry in which fashionable and political circles joined,
      and which was echoed by thousands who did not know whether Phalaris ruled
      in Sicily or in Siam. His spirit, daring even to rashness, self-confident
      even to negligence, and proud even to insolent ferocity, was awed for the
      first and for the last time, awed, not into meanness or cowardice, but
      into wariness and sobriety. For once he ran no risks; he left no crevice
      unguarded; he wantoned in no paradoxes; above all, he returned no railing
      for the railing of his enemies. In almost every thing that he has written
      we can discover proofs of genius and learning. But it is only here that
      his genius and learning appear to have been constantly under the guidance
      of good sense and good temper. Here, we find none of that besotted
      reliance on his own powers and on his own luck, which he showed when he
      undertook to édité Milton; none of that perverted ingenuity which deforms
      so many of his notes on Horace; none of that disdainful carelessness by
      which he laid himself open to the <span class="pagenum">112</span><a
      name="link112" id="link112"></a>keen and dexterous thrust of Middleton;
      none of that extravagant vaunting and savage scurrility by which he
      afterwards dishonoured his studies and his profession, and degraded
      himself almost to the level of De Pauw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple did not live to witness the utter and irreparable defeat of his
      champions. He died, indeed, at a fortunate moment, just after the
      appearance of Boyle&rsquo;s book, and while all England was laughing at the way
      in which the Christchurch men had handled the pedant. In Boyle&rsquo;s book,
      Temple was praised in the highest terms, and compared to Memmius: not a
      very happy comparison; for almost the only particular information which we
      have about Memmius is that, in agitated times, he thought it his duty to
      attend exclusively to politics, and that his friends could not venture,
      except when the Republic was quiet and prosperous, to intrude on him with
      their philosophical and poetical productions. It is on this account that
      Lucretius puts up the exquisitely beautiful prayer for peace with which
      his poem opens: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">&ldquo;Nam neque nos agere hoc
      patrial tempore iniquo <br /><span class="indent15">Possumus aequo animo,
      nee Memmî clara propago <br /><span class="indent15">Talibus in rebus
      communi deesse saluti.&rdquo; </span></span></span>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This description is surely by no means applicable to a statesman who had,
      through the whole course of his life, carefully avoided exposing himself
      in seasons of trouble; who had repeatedly refused, in most critical
      conjunctures, to be Secretary of State; and who now, in the midst of
      revolutions, plots, foreign and domestic wars, was quietly writing
      nonsense about the visits of Lycurgus to the Brahmins and the tunes which
      Arion played to the Dolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not omit to mention that, while the controversy about Phalaris was
      raging, Swift, in order <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113"
       id="link113"></a>to show his zeal and attachment, wrote the Battle of the
      Books, the earliest piece in which his peculiar talents are discernible.
      We may observe that the bitter dislike of Bentley, bequeathed by Temple to
      Swift, seems to have been communicated by Swift to Pope, to Arbuthnot, and
      to others, who continued to tease the great critic, long after he had
      shaken hands very cordially both with Boyle and with Atterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William Temple died at Moor Park in January, 1699. He appears to have
      suffered no intellectual decay. His heart was buried under a sun-dial
      which still stands in his favourite garden. His body was laid in
      Westminster Abbey by the side of his wife; and a place hard by was set
      apart for Lady Giffard, who long survived him. Swift was his literary
      executor, superintended the publication of his Letters and Memoirs, and,
      in the performance of this office, had some acrimonious contests with the
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Temple&rsquo;s character little more remains to be said. Burnet accuses him
      of holding irreligious opinions, and corrupting everybody who came near
      him. But the vague assertion of so rash and partial a writer as Bumet,
      about a man with whom, as far as we know, he never exchanged a word, is of
      little weight. It is, indeed, by no means improbable that Temple may have
      been a freethinker. The Osbornes thought him so when he was a very young
      man. And it is certain that a large proportion of the gentlemen of rank
      and fashion who made their entrance into society while the Puritan party
      was at the height of power, and while the memory of the reign of that
      party was still recent, conceived a strong disgust for all religion. The
      imputation was common between Temple and all the most distinguished
      courtiers of the age. Rochester <span class="pagenum">114</span><a
      name="link114" id="link114"></a>and Buckingham were open scoffers, and
      Mulgrave very little better. Shaftesbury, though more guarded, was
      supposed to agree with them in opinion. All the three noblemen who were
      Temple&rsquo;s colleagues during the short time of his sitting in the Cabinet
      were of very indifferent repute as to orthodoxy. Halifax, indeed, was
      generally considered as an atheist; but he solemnly denied the charge;
      and, indeed, the truth seems to be that he was more religiously disposed
      than most of the statesmen of that age, though two impulses which were
      unusually strong in him, a passion for ludicrous images, and a passion for
      subtle speculations, sometimes prompted him to talk on serious subjects in
      a manner which gave great and just offence. It is not unlikely that
      Temple, who seldom went below the surface of any question, may have been
      infected with the prevailing scepticism. All that we can say on the
      subject is, that there is no trace of impiety in his works, and that the
      ease with which he carried his election for an university, where the
      majority of the voters were clergymen, though it proves nothing as to his
      opinions, must, we think, be considered as proving that he was not, as
      Burnet seems to insinuate, in the habit of talking atheism to all who came
      near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, however, will scarcely carry with him any great accession of
      authority to the side either of religion or of infidelity. He was no
      profound thinker. He was merely a man of lively parts and quick
      observation, a man of the world among men of letters, a man of letters
      among men of the world. Mere scholars were dazzled by the Ambassador and
      Cabinet counsellor; mere politicians by the Essayist and Historian. But
      neither as a writer nor as a-statesman, can we allot to him any very high
      place. As a man, he seems to <span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a>as to have been excessively selfish, but
      very sober, wary, and far-sighted in his selfishness; to have known better
      than most people what he really wanted in life; and to have pursued what
      he wanted with much more than ordinary steadiness and sagacity, never
      suffering himself to be drawn aside either by bad or by good feelings. It
      was his constitution to dread failure more than he desired success, to
      prefer security, comfort, repose, leisure, to the turmoil and anxiety
      which are inseparable from greatness; and this natural languor of mind,
      when contrasted with the malignant energy of the keen and restless spirits
      among whom his lot was cast, sometimes appears to resemble the moderation
      of virtue. But we must own that he seems to us to sink into littleness and
      meanness when we compare him, we do not say with any high ideal standard
      of morality, but with many of those frail men who, aiming at noble ends,
      but often drawn from the right path by strong passions and strong
      temptations, have left to posterity a doubtful and checkered fame.

      GLADSTONE ON CHURCH AND STATE. (1)

      (Edinburgh Review, April, 1839.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <span
      class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a>author of
      this volume is a young man of unblemished character, and of distinguished
      parliamentary talents, the rising, hope of those stern and unbending
      Tories who follow, reluctantly and mutinously, a leader whose experience
      and eloquence are indispensable to them, but, whose cautious temper and
      moderate opinions they abhor. It would not be at all strange if Mr.
      Gladstone were one of the most unpopular men in England. But we believe
      that we do him no more than justice when we say: that his abilities and
      his demeanour have obtained for him the respect and good will of all
      parties. His first appearance in the character of an author is therefore
      an interesting event; and it is natural that the gentle wishes of the
      public should go with him to his trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are much pleased, without any reference to the soundness or unsoundness
      of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s theories, to see a grave and elaborate treatise on an
      important part of the Philosophy of Government proceed from the pen of a
      young man who is rising to eminence in the House of Commons. There is
      little danger that people engaged in the conflicts of active life will be
      too much

     (1)<i> The State in its Relations with the Church</i>. By W. E.
     Gladstone, Esq., Student of Christ Church, and M. P. for
     Newark. 8vo. Second Edition. London: 1839.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117" id="link117"></a>addicted
      to general speculation. The opposite vice is that which most easily besets
      them. The times and tides of business and debate tarry for no man. A
      politician must often talk and act before he has thought and read. He may
      be very ill informed respecting a question; all his notions about it may
      be vague and inaccurate; but speak he must; and if he is a man of ability,
      of tact, and of intrepidity, he soon finds that, even under such
      circumstances, it is possible to speak successfully. He finds that there
      is a great difference between the effect of written words, which are
      perused and reperused in the stillness of the closet, and the effect of
      spoken words which, set off by the graces of utterance and gesture,
      vibrate for a single moment on the ear. He finds that he may blunder
      without much chance of being detected, that he may reason sophistically,
      and escape unrefuted. He finds that, even on knotty questions of trade and
      legislation, he can, without reading ten pages, or thinking ten minutes,
      draw forth loud plaudits, and sit down with the credit of having made an
      excellent speech. Lysias, says Plutarch, wrote a defence for a man who was
      to be tried before one of the Athenian tribunals. Long before the
      defendant had learned the speech by heart, he became so much dissatisfied
      with it that he went in great distress to the author. &ldquo;I was delighted
      with your speech the first time I read it; but I liked it less the second
      time, and still less the third time; and now it seems to me to be no
      defence at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Lysias, &ldquo;you quite forget that the judges are to
      hear it only once.&rdquo; The case is the same in the English parliament. It
      would be as idle in an orator to waste deep meditation and long research
      on his speeches, as it would be in the manager of a theatre to <span
      class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>adorn all the
      crowd of courtiers and ladies who cross over the stage in a procession
      with real pearls and diamonds. It is not by accuracy or profundity that
      men become the masters of great assemblies. And why be at the charge of
      providing logic of the best quality, when a very inferior article will be
      equally acceptable? Why go as deep into a question as Burke, only in order
      to be, like Burke, coughed down, or left speaking to green benches and red
      boxes? This has long appeared to us to be the most serious of the evils
      which are to be set off against the many blessings of popular government.
      It is a fine and true saying of Bacon, that reading makes a full man,
      talking a ready man, and writing an exact man. The tendency of
      institutions like those of England is to encourage readiness in public
      men, at the expense both of fulness and of exactness. The keenest and most
      vigorous minds of every generation, minds often admirably fitted for the
      investigation of truth, are habitually employed in producing arguments
      such as no man of sense would ever put into a treatise intended for
      publication, arguments which are just good enough to be used once, when
      aided by fluent delivery and pointed language. The habit of discussing
      questions in this way necessarily reacts on the intellects of our ablest
      men, particularly of those who are introduced into parliament at a very
      early age, before their minds have expanded to full maturity. The talent
      for debate is developed in such men to a degree which, to the multitude,
      seems as marvellous as the performance of an Italian <i>Improvisatore</i>.
      But they are fortunate indeed if they retain unimpaired, the faculties
      which are required for close reasoning or for enlarged speculation. Indeed
      we should sooner expect a great original work on political science, such a
      work, for example, <span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119"
       id="link119"></a>as the Wealth of Nations, from an apothecary in a country
      town, or from a minister in the Hebrides, than from a statesman who, ever
      since he was one-and-twenty, had been a distinguished debater in the House
      of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      We therefore hail with pleasure, though assuredly not with unmixed
      pleasure, the appearance of this work. That a young politician should, in
      the intervals afforded by his parliamentary avocations, have constructed
      and propounded, with much study and mental toil, an original theory on a
      great problem in politics, is a circumstance which, abstracted from all
      consideration of the soundness or unsoundness of his opinions, must be
      considered as highly creditable to him. We certainly cannot wish that Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s doctrines may become fashionable among public men. But we
      heartily wish that his laudable desire to penetrate beneath the surface of
      questions, and to arrive, by long and intent meditation, at the knowledge
      of great general laws, were much more fashionable than we at all expect it
      to become.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone seems to us to be, in many respects, exceedingly well
      qualified for philosophical investigation. His mind is of large grasp; nor
      is he deficient in dialectical skill. But he does not give his intellect
      fair play. There is no want of light, but a great want of what Bacon would
      have called dry light. Whatever Mr. Gladstone sees is refracted and
      distorted by a false medium of passions and prejudices. His style bears a
      remarkable analogy to his mode of Blinking, and indeed exercises great
      influence on his mode of thinking. His rhetoric, though often good of its
      kind, darkens and perplexes the logic which it should illustrate. Half his
      acuteness and diligence, with a barren imagination <span class="pagenum">120</span><a
      name="link120" id="link120"></a>and a scanty vocabulary, would have saved
      him from almost all his mistakes. He has one gift most dangerous to a
      speculator, a vast command of a kind of language, grave and majestic, but
      of vague and uncertain import; of a kind of language which affects us much
      in the same way in which the lofty diction of the Chorus of Clouds
      affected the simple-hearted Athenian.

    <p>
      When propositions have been established, and nothing remains but to
      amplify and decorate them, this dim magnificence may be in place. But if
      it is admitted into a demonstration, it is very much worse than absolute
      nonsense; just as that transparent haze, through which the sailor sees
      capes and mountains of false sizes and in false bearings, is more
      dangerous than utter darkness. Now, Mr. Gladstone is fond of employing the
      phraseology of which we speak in those parts of his works which require
      the utmost perspicuity and precision of which human language is capable;
      and in this way he deludes first himself, and then his readers. The
      foundations of his theory, which ought to be buttresses of adamant, are
      made out of the flimsy materials which are fit only for perorations. This
      fault is one which no subsequent care or industry can correct. The more
      strictly Mr. Gladstone reasons on his premises, the more absurd are the
      conclusions which he brings out; and, when at last his good sense and good
      nature recoil from the horrible practical inferences to which his theory
      leads, he is reduced sometimes to take refuge in arguments inconsistent
      with his fundamental doctrines, and sometimes to escape from the
      legitimate consequences of his false principles, under cover of equally
      false history. <span class="pagenum">121</span><a name="link121"
       id="link121"></a>It would be unjust not to say that this book, though not
      a good book, shows more talent than many good books. It abounds with
      eloquent and ingenious passages. It bears the signs of much patient
      thought. It is written throughout with excellent taste and excellent
      temper; nor does it, so far as we have observed, contain one expression
      unworthy of a gentleman, a scholar, or a Christian. But the doctrines
      which are put forth in it appear to us, after full and calm consideration,
      to be false, to be in the highest degree pernicious, and to be such as, if
      followed out in practice to their legitimate consequences, would
      inevitably produce the dissolution of society; and for this opinion we
      shall proceed to give our reasons with that freedom which the importance
      of the subject requires, and which Mr. Gladstone, both by precept and by
      example, invites us to use, but, we hope, without rudeness, and, we are
      sure, without malevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we enter on an examination of this theory, we wish to guard
      ourselves against one misconception. It is possible that some persons who
      have read Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s book carelessly, and others who have merely
      heard in conversation, or seen in a newspaper, that the member for Newark
      has written in defence of the Church of England against the supporters of
      the voluntary system, may imagine that we are writing in defence of the
      voluntary system, and that we desire the abolition of the Established
      Church. This is not the case. It would be as unjust to accuse us of
      attacking the Church, because we attack Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s doctrines, as it
      would be to accuse Locke of wishing for anarchy, because he refuted
      Filmer&rsquo;s patriarchal theory of government, or to accuse Blackstone of
      recommending the confiscation of ecclesiastical property, because <span
      class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>he denied
      that the right of the rector to tithe was derived from the Levitical law.
      It is to be observed, that Mr. Gladstone rests his case on entirely new
      grounds, and does not differ more widely from us than from some of those
      who have hitherto been considered as the most illustrious champions of the
      Church. He is not content with the Ecclesiastical Polity, and rejoices
      that the latter part of that celebrated work &ldquo;does not carry with it the
      weight of Hooker&rsquo;s plenary authority.&rdquo; He is not content with Bishop
      Warburton&rsquo;s Alliance of Church and State. &ldquo;The propositions of that work
      generally,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are to be received with qualification,&rdquo; and he
      agrees with Bolingbroke in thinking that Warburton&rsquo;s whole theory rests on
      a fiction. He is still less satisfied with Paley&rsquo;s defence of the Church,
      which he pronounces to be &ldquo;tainted by the original vice of false ethical
      principles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;full of the seeds of evil.&rdquo; He conceives that Dr.
      Chalmers has taken a partial view of the subject, and &ldquo;put forth much
      questionable matter.&rdquo; In truth, on almost every point on which we are
      opposed to Mr. Gladstone, we have on our side the authority of some
      divine, eminent as a defender of existing establishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s whole theory rests on this great fundamental proposition,
      that the propagation of religious truth is one of the principal ends of
      government, as government. If Mr. Gladstone has not proved this
      proposition, his system vanishes at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are desirous, before we enter on the discussion of this important
      question, to point out clearly a distinction which, though very obvious,
      seems to be overlooked by many excellent people. In their opinion, to say
      that the ends of government are temporal and not spiritual is tantamount
      to saying that the temporal <span class="pagenum">123</span><a
      name="link123" id="link123"></a>welfare of man is of more importance than
      his spiritual welfare. But this is an entire mistake. The question is not
      whether spiritual interests be or be not superior in importance to
      temporal interests; but whether the machinery which happens at any moment
      to be employed for the purpose of protecting certain temporal interests of
      a society be necessarily such a machinery as is fitted to promote the
      spiritual interests of that society. Without a division of labour the
      world could not go on. It is of very much more importance that men should
      have food than that they should have pianofortes. Yet it by no means
      follows that every pianoforte-maker ought to add the business of a baker
      to his own; for, if he did so, we should have both much worse music and
      much worse bread. It is of much more importance that the knowledge of
      religious truth should be wisely diffused than that the art of sculpture
      should flourish among us. Yet it by no means follows that the Royal
      Academy ought to unite with its present functions those of the Society for
      Promoting Christian Knowledge, to distribute theological tracts, to send
      forth missionaries, to turn out Nollekens for being a Catholic, Bacon for
      being a methodist, and Flaxman for being a Swedenborgian. For the effect
      of such folly would be that we should have the worst possible Academy of
      Arts, and the worst possible Society for the Promotion of Christian
      Knowledge. The community, it is plain, would be thrown into universal
      confusion, if it were supposed to be the duty of every association which
      is formed for one good object to promote every other good object.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to some of the ends of civil government, all people are agreed. That it
      is designed to protect our persons and our property; that it is designed
      to compel <span class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124" id="link124"></a>as
      to satisfy our wants, not by rapine, but by industry; that it is designed
      to compel us to decide our differences, not by the strong hand, but by
      arbitration; that it is designed to direct our whole force, as that of one
      man, against any other society which may offer us injury; these are
      propositions which will hardly be disputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now these are matters in which man, without any reference to any higher
      being, or to any future state, is very deeply interested. Every human
      being, be he idolater, Mahometan, Jew, Papist, Socinian, Deist, or
      Atheist, naturally loves life, shrinks from pain, desires comforts which
      can be enjoyed only in communities where property is secure. To be
      murdered, to be tortured, to be robbed, to be sold into slavery, these are
      evils from which men of every religion, and men of no religion, wish to be
      protected; and therefore it will hardly be disputed that men of every
      religion, and of no religion, have thus far a common interest in being
      well governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hopes and fears of man are not limited to this short life, and to
      this visible world. He finds himself surrounded by the signs of a power
      and wisdom higher than his own; and, in all ages and nations, men of all
      orders of intellect, from Bacon and Newton down to the rudest tribes of
      cannibals, have believed in the existence of some superior mind. Thus far
      the voice of mankind is almost unanimous. But whether there be one God or
      many, what may be God&rsquo;s natural and what His moral attributes, in what
      relation His creatures stand to Him, whether He have ever disclosed
      Himself to us by any other revelation than that which is written in all
      the parts of the glorious and well-ordered world which He has made,
      whether His revelation be <span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125"
       id="link125"></a>contained in any permanent record, how that record should
      be interpreted, and whether it have pleased Him to appoint any unerring
      interpreter on earth, these are questions respecting which there exists
      the widest diversity of opinion, and respecting some of which a large part
      of our race has, ever since the dawn of regular history, been deplorably
      in error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here are two great objects: one is the protection of the persons and
      estates of citizens from injury; the other is the propagation of religious
      truth. No two objects more entirely distinct can well be imagined. The
      former belongs wholly to the visible and tangible world in which we live;
      the latter belongs to that higher world which is beyond the reach of our
      senses. The former belongs to this life; the latter to that which is to
      come. Men who are perfectly agreed as to the importance of the former
      object, and as to the way of obtaining it, differ as widely as possible
      respecting the latter object. We must, therefore, pause before we admit
      that the persons, be they who they may, who are intrusted with power for
      the promotion of the former object, ought always to use that power for the
      promotion of the latter object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone conceives that the duties of governments are paternal; a
      doctrine which we shall not believe till he can show us some government
      which loves its subjects as a father loves a child, and which is as
      superior in intelligence to its subjects as a father is to a child. He
      tells us in lofty, though somewhat indistinct language, that &ldquo;Government
      occupies in moral the place of [Greek] in physical science.&rdquo; If government
      be indeed [Greek] in moral science, we do not understand why rulers should
      not assume all the functions which Plato assigned to them. Why should they
      <span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126" id="link126"></a>not
      take away the child from the mother, select the nurse, regulate the
      school, overlook the playground, fix the hours of labour and of
      recreation, prescribe what ballads shall be sung, what tunes shall be
      played, what books shall be read, what physic shall be swallowed? Why
      should not they choose our wives, limit our expenses, and stint us to a
      certain number of dishes of meat, of glasses of wine, and of cups of tea?
      Plato, whose hardihood in speculation was perhaps more wonderful than any
      other peculiarity of his extraordinary mind, and who shrank from nothing
      to which his principles led, went this whole length. Mr. Gladstone is not
      so intrepid. He contents himself with laying down this proposition, that,
      whatever be the body which in any community is employed to protect the
      persons and property of men, that body ought also, in its corporate
      capacity, to profess a religion, to employ its power for the propagation
      of that religion, and to require conformity to that religion, as an
      indispensable qualification for all civil office. He distinctly declares
      that he does not in this proposition confine his view to orthodox
      governments or even to Christian governments. The circumstance that a
      religion is false does not, he tells us, diminish the obligation of
      governors, as such, to uphold it. If they neglect to do so, &ldquo;we cannot,&rdquo;
       he says, &ldquo;but regard the fact as aggravating the case of the holders of
      such creed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not scruple to affirm,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;that, if a Mahometan
      conscientiously believes his religion to come from God, and to teach
      divine truth, he must believe that truth to be beneficial, and beneficial
      beyond all other things to the soul of man; and he must therefore, and
      ought to desire its extension, and to use for its extension all proper and
      legitimate means; and that, if such Mahometan <span class="pagenum">127</span><a
      name="link127" id="link127"></a>be a prince, he ought to count among those
      means the application of whatever influence or funds he may lawfully have
      at his disposal for such purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surely this is a hard saying. Before we admit that the Emperor Julian, in
      employing the influence and the funds at his disposal for the extinction
      of Christianity, was doing no more than his duty, before we admit that the
      Arian Theodoric would have committed a crime if he had suffered a single
      believer in the divinity of Christ to hold any civil employment in Italy,
      before we admit that the Dutch Government is bound to exclude from office
      all members of the Church of England, the King of Bavaria to exclude from
      office all Protestants, the Great Turk to exclude from office all
      Christians, the King of Ava to exclude from office all who hold the unity
      of God, we think ourselves entitled to demand very full and accurate
      demonstration. When the consequences of a doctrine are so startling, we
      may well require that its foundations shall be very solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following paragraph is a specimen of the arguments by which Mr.
      Gladstone has, as he conceives, established his great fundamental
      proposition:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We may state the same proposition in a more general form, in which it
      surely must command universal assent. Wherever there is power in the
      universe, that power is the property of God, the King of that universe&mdash;his
      property of right, however for a time withholden or abused. Now this
      property is, as it were, realised, is used according to the will of the
      owner, when it is used for the purposes he has ordained, and in the temper
      of mercy, justice, truth, and faith which he has taught us; But those
      principles never can be truly, never can be permanently, entertained in
      the human breast, except by a continual reference to their source, and the
      supply of the Divine grace. The powers, therefore, that dwell in
      individuals acting as a government, as well as those that <span
      class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>dwell in
      individuals acting for themselves, can only be secured for right uses by
      applying to them a religion.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here are propositions of vast and indefinite extent, conveyed in language
      which has a certain obscure dignity and sanctity, attractive, we doubt
      not, to many minds. But the moment that we examine these propositions
      closely, the moment that we bring them to the test by running over but a
      very few of the particulars which are included in them, we find them to be
      false and extravagant. The doctrine which &ldquo;must surely command universal
      assent&rdquo; is this, that every association of human beings which exercises
      any power whatever, that is to say, every association of human beings, is
      bound, as such association, to profess a religion. Imagine the effect
      which would follow if this principle were really in force during
      four-and-twenty hours. Take one instance out of a million. A stagecoach
      company has power over its horses. This power is the property of God. It
      is used according to the will of God when it is used with mercy. But the
      principle of mercy can never be truly or permanently entertained in the
      human breast without continual reference to God. The powers, therefore,
      that dwell in individuals, acting as a stage-coach company, can only be
      secured for right uses by applying to them a religion. Every stage-coach
      company ought, therefore, in its collective capacity, to profess some one
      faith, to have its articles, and its public, worship, and its tests. That
      this conclusion, and an infinite number of other conclusions equally
      strange, follow of necessity from Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s principle, is as certain
      as it is that two and two make four. And, if the legitimate conclusions be
      so absurd, there must be something unsound in the principle. <span
      class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>We will quote
      another passage of the same sort:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why, then, we now come to ask, should the governing body in a state
      profess a religion? First, because it is composed of individual men; and
      they, being appointed to act in a definite moral capacity, must sanctify
      their acts done in that capacity by the offices of religion; inasmuch as
      the acts cannot otherwise be acceptable to God, or any thing but sinful
      and punishable in themselves. And whenever we turn our face away from God
      in our conduct, we are living atheistically.... In fulfilment, then, of
      his obligations as an individual, the statesman must be a worshipping man.
      But his acts are public&mdash;the powers and instruments with which he
      works are public&mdash;acting under and by the authority of the law, he
      moves at his word ten thousand subject arms; and because such energies are
      thus essentially public, and wholly out of the range of mere individual
      agency, they must be sanctified not only by the private personal prayers
      and piety of those who fill public situations, but also by public acts of
      the men composing the public body. They must offer prayer and praise in
      their public and collective character&mdash;in that character wherein they
      constitute the organ of the nation, and wield its collective force.
      Wherever there is a reasoning agency, there is a moral duty and
      responsibility involved in it. The governors are reasoning agents for the
      nation, in their conjoint acts as such. And therefore there must be
      attached to this agency, as that without which none of our
      responsibilities can be met, a religion. And this religion must be that of
      the conscience of the governor, or none.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here again we find propositions of vast sweep, and of sound so orthodox
      and solemn that many good people, we doubt not, have been greatly edified
      by it. But let us examine the words closely; and it will immediately
      become plain that, if these principles be once admitted, there is an end
      of all society. No combination can be formed for any purpose of mutual
      help, for trade, for public works, for the relief of the sick or the poor,
      for the promotion of art or science, unless the members of the combination
      agree in their theological <span class="pagenum">130</span><a
      name="link130" id="link130"></a>opinions. Take any such combination at
      random, the London and Birmingham Railway Company for example, and observe
      to what consequences Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s arguments inevitably lead. &ldquo;Why
      should the Directors of the Railway Company, in their collective capacity,
      profess a religion? First, because the direction is composed of individual
      men appointed to act in a definite moral capacity, bound to look carefully
      to the property, the limbs, and the lives of their fellow-creatures, bound
      to act diligently for their constituents, bound to govern their servants
      with humanity and justice, bound to fulfil with fidelity many important
      contracts. They must, therefore, sanctify their acts by the offices of
      religion, or these acts will be sinful and punishable in themselves. In
      fulfilment, then, of his obligations as an individual, the Director of the
      London and Birmingham Railway Company must be a worshipping man. But his
      acts are public. He acts for a body. He moves at his word ten thousand
      subject arms. And because these energies are out of the range of his mere
      individual agency, they must be sanctified by public acts of devotion. The
      Railway Directors must offer prayer and praise in their public and
      collective character, in that character wherewith they constitute the
      organ of the Company, and wield its collected power. Wherever there is
      reasoning agency, there is moral responsibility. The Directors are
      reasoning agents for the Company. And therefore there must be attached to
      this agency, as that without which none of our responsibilities can be
      met, a religion. And this religion must be that of the conscience of the
      Director himself, or none. There must be public worship and a test. No
      Jew, no Socinian, no Presbyterian, no Catholic, no Quaker, must be
      permitted to be the organ of <span class="pagenum">131</span><a
      name="link131" id="link131"></a>the Company, and to wield its collected
      force.&rdquo; Would Mr. Gladstone really defend this proposition? We are sure
      that he would not: but we are sure that to this proposition, and to
      innumerable similar propositions, his reasoning inevitably leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>National will and agency are indisputably one, binding either a
      dissentient minority or the subject body, in a manner that nothing but the
      recognition of the doctrine of national personality can justify. National
      honour and good faith are words in every one&rsquo;s mouth. How do they less
      imply a personality in nations than the duty towards God, for which we now
      contend? They are strictly and essentially distinct from the honour and
      good faith of the individuals composing the nation. France is a person to
      us, and we to her. A wilful injury done to her is a moral act, and a moral
      act quite distinct from the acts of all the individuals composing the
      nation. Upon broad facts like these we may rest, without resorting to the
      more technical proof which the laws afford in their manner of dealing with
      corporations. If, then, a nation have unity of will, have pervading
      sympathies, have capability of reward and suffering contingent upon its
      acts, shall we deny its responsibility; its need of a religion to meet
      that responsibility?.... A nation, then, having a personality, lies under
      the obligation, like the individuals composing its governing body, of
      sanctifying the acts of that personality by the offices of religion, and
      thus we have a new and imperative ground for the existence of a state
      religion</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A new ground we have here, certainly, but whether very imperative may be
      doubted. Is it not perfectly clear, that this argument applies with
      exactly as much force to every combination of human beings for a common
      purpose, as to governments? Is there any such combination in the world,
      whether technically a corporation or not, which has not this collective
      personality, from which Mr. Gladstone deduces such extraordinary
      consequences? Look at banks, insurance offices, dock companies, canal
      companies, gas companies, hospitals, <span class="pagenum">132</span><a
      name="link132" id="link132"></a>dispensaries, associations for the relief
      of the poor, associations for apprehending malefactors, associations of
      medical pupils for procuring subjects, associations of country gentlemen
      for keeping fox-hounds, book societies, benefit societies, clubs of all
      ranks, from those which have lined Pall-Mall and St. James&rsquo;s Street with
      their palaces, down to the Free-and-easy which meets in the shabby parlour
      of a village inn. Is there a single one of these combinations to which Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s argument will not apply as well as to the State? In all these
      combinations, in the Bank of England, for example, or in the Athenæum
      club, the will and agency of the society are one, and bind the dissentient
      minority. The Bank and the Athenaeum have a good faith and a justice
      different from the good faith and justice of the individual members. The
      Bank is a person to those who deposit bullion with it. The Athenaeum is a
      person to the butcher and the wine-merchant. If the Athenaeum keeps money
      at the Bank, the two societies are as much persons to each other as
      England and France. Either society may pay its debts honestly; either may
      try to defraud its creditors; either may increase in prosperity; either
      may fall into difficulties. If, then, they have this unity of will; if
      they are capable of doing and suffering good and evil, can we, to use Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;deny their responsibility, or their need of a religion
      to meet that responsibility?&rdquo; Joint-stock banks, therefore, and clubs,
      &ldquo;having a personality, lie under the necessity of sanctifying that
      personality by the offices of religion;&rdquo; and thus we have &ldquo;a new and
      imperative ground&rdquo; for requiring all the directors and clerks of
      joint-stock banks, and all the members of clubs, to qualify by taking the
      sacrament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that Mr. Gladstone has fallen into an <span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a>error very common among men of less
      talents than his own. It is not unusual for a person who is eager to prove
      a particular proposition to assume a <i>major</i> of huge extent, which
      includes that particular proposition, without ever reflecting that it
      includes a great deal more. The fatal facility with which Mr. Gladstone
      multiplies expressions stately and sonorous, but of indeterminate meaning,
      eminently qualifies him to practise this sleight on himself and on his
      readers. He lays down broad general doctrines about power, when the only
      power of which he is thinking is the power of governments, and about
      conjoint action when the only conjoint action of which he is thinking is
      the conjoint action of citizens in a state. He first resolves on his
      conclusion. He then makes a <i>major</i> of most comprehensive dimensions,
      and having satisfied himself that it contains his conclusion, never
      troubles himself about what else it may contain: and as soon as we examine
      it we find that it contains an infinite number of conclusions, every one
      of which is a monstrous absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfectly true that it would be a very good thing if all the members
      of all the associations in the world were men of sound religious views. We
      have no doubt that a good Christian will be under the guidance of
      Christian principles, in his conduct as director of a canal company or
      steward of a charity dinner. If he were, to recur to a case which we have
      before put, a member of a stage-coach company, he would, in that capacity,
      remember that &ldquo;a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.&rdquo; But it
      does not follow that every association of men must, therefore, as such
      association, profess a religion. It is evident that many great and useful
      objects can be attained in this <span class="pagenum">134</span><a
      name="link134" id="link134"></a>world only by co-operation. It is equally
      evident that there cannot be efficient co-operation, if men proceed on the
      principle that they must not co-operate for one object unless they agree
      about other objects. Nothing seems to us more beautiful or admirable in
      our social system than the facility with which thousands of people, who
      perhaps agree only on a single point, can combine their energies for the
      purpose of carrying that single point. We see daily instances of this. Two
      men, one of them obstinately prejudiced against missions, the other
      president of a missionary society, sit together at the board of a
      hospital, and heartily concur in measures for the health and comfort of
      the patients. Two men, one of whom is a zealous supporter and the other a
      zealous opponent of the system pursued in Lancaster&rsquo;s schools, meet at the
      Mendicity Society, and act together with the utmost cordiality. The
      general rule we take to be undoubtedly this, that it is lawful and
      expedient for men to unite in an association for the promotion of a good
      object, though they may differ with respect to other objects of still
      higher importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will hardly be denied that the security of the persons and property of
      men is a good object, and that the best way, indeed the only way of
      promoting that object, is to combine men together in certain great
      corporations which are called States. These corporations are very
      variously, and, for the most part, very imperfectly organized. Many of
      them abound with frightful abuses. But it seems reasonable to believe that
      the worst that ever existed was, on the whole, preferable to complete
      anarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, reasoning from analogy, we should say that these great corporations
      would, like all other associations, <span class="pagenum">135</span><a
      name="link135" id="link135"></a>be likely to attain their end most
      perfectly if that end were kept singly in view; and that to refuse the
      services of those who are admirably qualified to promote that end, because
      they are not also qualified to promote some other end, however excellent,
      seems at first sight as unreasonable as it would be to provide that nobody
      who was not a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries should be a governor of
      the Eye Infirmary; or that nobody who was not a member of the Society for
      promoting Christianity among the Jews should be a trustee of the Literary
      Fund.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to name any collection of human beings to which Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s reasonings would apply more strongly than to an army? Where
      shall we find more complete unity of action than in an army? Where else do
      so many human beings implicitly obey one ruling mind? What other mass is
      there which moves so much like one man? Where is such tremendous power
      intrusted to those who command? Where is so awful a responsibility laid
      upon them? If Mr. Gladstone has made out, as he conceives, an imperative
      necessity for a State Religion, much more has he made it out to be
      imperatively necessary that every army should, in its collective capacity,
      profess a religion. Is he prepared to adopt this consequence?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the thirteenth of August, in the year 1704, two great
      captains, equal in authority, united by close private and public ties, but
      of different creeds, prepared for a battle, on the event of which were
      staked the liberties of Europe. Marlborough had passed a part of the night
      in prayer, and before daybreak received the sacrament according to the
      rites of the Church of England. He then hastened to join Eugene, <span
      class="pagenum">136</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>who had
      probably just confessed himself to a Popish priest. The generals consulted
      together, formed their plan in concert, and repaired each to his own post.
      Marlborough gave orders for public prayers. The English chaplains read the
      service at the head of the English regiments. The Calvinistic chaplains of
      the Dutch army, with heads on which hand of Bishop had never been laid,
      poured forth their supplications in front of their countrymen. In the mean
      time, the Danes might listen to their Lutheran ministers; and Capuchins
      might encourage the Austrian squadrons, and pray to the Virgin for a
      blessing on the arms of the Holy Roman Empire. The battle commences. These
      men of various religions all act like members of one body. The Catholic
      and the Protestant general exert themselves to assist and to surpass each
      other. Before sunset the Empire is saved: France has lost in a day the
      fruits of eighty years of intrigue and of victory; and the allies, after
      conquering together, return thanks to God separately, each after his own
      form of worship. Now is this practical atheism? Would any man in his
      senses say, that, because the allied army had unity of action and a common
      interest, and because a heavy responsibility lay on its Chiefs, it was
      therefore imperatively necessary that the Army should, as an Army, have
      one established religion, that Eugene should be deprived of his command
      for being a Catholic, that all the Dutch and Austrian colonels should be
      broken for not subscribing the Thirty-nine Articles? Certainly not. The
      most ignorant grenadier on the field of battle would have seen the
      absurdity of such a proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he would have said, &ldquo;that the Prince of Savoy goes to mass, and
      that our Corporal John cannot abide it; but what has the mass to do with
      the taking <span class="pagenum">137</span><a name="link137" id="link137"></a>of
      the village of Blenheim? The Prince wants to beat the French, and so does
      Corporal John. If we stand by each other we shall most likely beat them.
      If we send all the Papists and Dutch away, Tallard will have every man of
      us.&rdquo; Mr. Gladstone himself, we imagine, would admit that our honest
      grenadier would have the best of the argument; and if so, what follows?
      Even this; that all Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s general principles about power, and
      responsibility, and personality, and conjoint action, must be given up,
      and that, if his theory is to stand at all, it must stand on some other
      foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now, we conceive, shown that it may be proper to form men into
      combinations for important purposes, which combinations shall have unity
      and common interests, and shall be under the direction of rulers intrusted
      with great power and lying under solemn responsibility, and yet that it
      may be highly improper that these combinations should, as such, profess
      any one system of religious belief, or perform any joint act of religious
      worship. How, then, is it proved that this may not be the case with some
      of those great combinations which we call States? We firmly believe that
      it is the case with some States. We firmly believe that there are
      communities in which it would be as absurd to mix up theology with
      government, as it would have been in the right wing of the allied army at
      Blenheim to commence a controversy with the left wing, in the middle of
      the battle, about purgatory and the worship of images.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the duty, Mr. Gladstone tells us, of the persons, be they who they
      may, who hold supreme power in the state, to employ that power in order to
      promote whatever they may deem to be theological truth. Now, surely,
      before he can call on us to admit this proposition, <span class="pagenum">138</span><a
      name="link138" id="link138"></a>he is bound to prove that these persons
      are likely to do more good than harm by so employing their power. The
      first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the
      propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more
      likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong? Mr. Gladstone
      evades this question; and perhaps it was his wisest course to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the government be good, let it have its natural duties
      and powers at its command; but, if not good, let it be made so.... We
      follow, therefore, the true course in looking first for the true [Greek]
      or abstract conception of a government, of course with allowance for the
      evil and frailty that are in man, and then in examining whether there be
      comprised in that [Greek] a capacity and consequent duty on the part of a
      government to lay down any laws, or devote any means for the purposes of
      religion,&mdash;in short, to exercise a choice upon religion</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Mr. Gladstone has a perfect right to argue any abstract
      question, provided that he will constantly bear in mind that it is only an
      abstract question that he is arguing. Whether a perfect government would
      or would not be a good machinery for the propagation of religious truth is
      certainly a harmless, and may, for aught we know, be an edifying subject
      of inquiry. But it is very important that we should remember that there is
      not, and never has been, any such government in the world. There is no
      harm at all in inquiring what course a stone thrown into the air would
      take, if the law of gravitation did not operate. But the consequences
      would be unpleasant, if the inquirer, as soon as he had finished his
      calculation, were to begin to throw stones about in all directions,
      without considering that his conclusion rests on a false hypothesis, and
      that his projectiles, instead of flying away through infinite <span
      class="pagenum">139</span><a name="link139" id="link139"></a>space, will
      speedily return in parabolas, and break the windows and heads of his
      neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very easy to say that governments are good, or if not good, ought to
      be made so. But what is meant by good government? And how are all the bad
      governments in the world to be made good? And of what value is a theory
      which is true only on a supposition in the highest degree extravagant?
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not, however, admit that, if a government were, for all its temporal
      ends, as perfect as human frailty allows, such a government would,
      therefore, be necessarily qualified to propagate true religion. For we see
      that the fitness of governments to propagate true religion is by no means
      proportioned to their fitness for the temporal end of their institution.
      Looking at individuals, we see that the princes under whose rule nations
      have been most ably protected from foreign and domestic disturbance, and
      have made the most rapid advances in civilisation, have been by no means
      good teachers of divinity. Take, for example, the best French sovereign,
      Henry the Fourth, a king who restored order, terminated a terrible civil
      war, brought the finances into an excellent condition, made his country
      respected throughout Europe, and endeared himself to the great body of the
      people whom he ruled. Yet this man was twice a Huguenot, and twice a
      Papist. He was, as Davila hints, strongly suspected of having no religion
      at all in theory, and was certainly not much under religious restraints in
      his practice. Take the Czar Peter, the Empress Catharine, Frederic the
      Great. It will surely not be disputed that these sovereigns, with all
      their faults, were, if we consider them with reference merely to the
      temporal ends of government, above the average of merit. Considered as
      theological guides, <span class="pagenum">140</span><a name="link140"
       id="link140"></a>Mr. Gladstone would probably put them below the most
      abject drivellers of the Spanish branch of the house of Bourbon. Again,
      when we pass from individuals to systems, we by no means find that the
      aptitude of governments for propagating religious truth is proportioned to
      their aptitude for secular functions. Without being blind admirers either
      of the French or of the American institutions, we think it clear that the
      persons and property of citizens are better protected in France and in New
      England than in almost any society that now exists, or that has ever
      existed; very much better, certainly, than in the Roman empire under the
      orthodox rule of Constantine and Theodosius. But neither the government of
      France, nor that of New England, is so organized as to be fit for the
      propagation of theological doctrines. Nor do we think it improbable that
      the most serious religious errors might prevail in a state which,
      considered merely with reference to temporal objects, might approach far
      nearer than any that has ever been known, to the idea of what a state
      should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we shall leave this abstract question, and look at the world as we
      find it. Does, then, the way in which governments generally obtain their
      power make it at all probable that they will be more favourable to
      orthodoxy than to heterodoxy? A nation of barbarians pours down on a rich
      and un warlike empire, enslaves the people, portions out the land, and
      blends the institutions which it finds in the cities with those which it
      has brought from the woods. A handful of daring adventurers from a
      civilised nation wander to some savage country, and reduce the aboriginal
      race to bondage. A successful general turns his arms against the state
      which he serves. A society, made brutal by oppression, rises madly on its
      masters, sweeps away all <span class="pagenum">141</span><a name="link141"
       id="link141"></a>old laws and usages, and, when its first paroxysm of rage
      is over, sinks down passively under any form of polity which may spring
      out of the chaos. A chief of a party, as at Florence, becomes
      imperceptibly a sovereign, and the founder of a dynasty. A captain of
      mercenaries, as at Milan, seizes on a city, and by the sword makes himself
      its ruler. An elective senate, as at Venice, usurps permanent and
      hereditary power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in events such as these that governments have generally originated;
      and we can see nothing in such events to warrant us in believing that the
      governments thus called into existence will be peculiarly well fitted to
      distinguish between religious truth and heresy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, again, we look at the constitutions of governments which have become
      settled, we find no great security for the orthodoxy of rulers. One
      magistrate holds power because his name was drawn out of a purse; another,
      because his father held it before him. There are representative systems of
      all sorts, large constituent bodies, small constituent bodies, universal
      suffrage, high pecuniary qualifications. We see that, for the temporal
      ends of government, some of these constitutions are very skilfully
      constructed, and that the very worst of them is preferable to anarchy. We
      see some sort of connection between the very worst of them and the
      temporal well-being of society. But it passes our understanding to
      comprehend what connection any one of them has with theological truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how stands the fact? Have not almost all the governments in the world
      always been in the wrong on religious subjects? Mr. Gladstone, we imagine,
      would say that, except in the time of Constantine, of Jovian, and of a
      very few of their successors, and occasionally in England since the
      Reformation, no government <span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a>has ever been sincerely friendly to the
      pure and apostolical Church of Christ. If, therefore, it be true that
      every ruler is bound in conscience to use his power for the propagation of
      his own religion, it will follow that, for one ruler who has been bound in
      conscience to use his power for the propagation of truth, a thousand have
      been bound in conscience to use their power for the propagation of
      falsehood. Surely this is a conclusion from which common sense recoils.
      Surely, if experience shows that a certain machine, when used to produce a
      certain effect, does not produce that effect once in a thousand times, but
      produces, in the vast majority of cases, an effect directly contrary, we
      cannot be wrong in saying that it is not a machine of which the principal
      end is to be so used.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, indeed, the magistrate would content himself with laying his opinions
      and reasons before the people, and would leave the people, uncorrupted by
      hope or fear, to judge for themselves, we should see little reason to
      apprehend that his interference in favour of error would be seriously
      prejudicial to the interests of truth. Nor do we, as will hereafter be
      seen, object to his taking this course, when it is compatible with the
      efficient discharge of his more especial duties. But this will not satisfy
      Mr. Gladstone. He would have the magistrate resort to means which have a
      great tendency to make malcontents, to make hypocrites, to make careless
      nominal conformists, but no tendency whatever to produce honest and
      rational conviction. It seems to us quite clear that an inquirer who has
      no wish except to know the truth is more likely to arrive at the truth
      than an inquirer who knows that, if he decides one way, he shall be
      rewarded, and that, if he decides the other way, he shall be punished.
      Now, <span class="pagenum">143</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>Mr.
      Gladstone would have governments propagate their opinions by excluding all
      dissenters from all civil offices. That is to say, he would have
      governments propagate their opinions by a process which has no reference
      whatever to the truth or falsehood of those opinions, by arbitrarily
      uniting certain worldly advantages with one set of doctrines, and certain
      worldly inconveniences with another set. It is of the very nature of
      argument to serve the interests of truth; but if rewards and punishments
      serve the interests of truth, it is by mere accident. It is very much
      easier to find arguments for the divine authority of the Gospel than for
      the divine authority of the Koran. But it is just as easy to bribe or rack
      a Jew into Mahometanism as into Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From racks, indeed, and from all penalties directed against the persons,
      the property, and the liberty of heretics, the humane spirit of Mr.
      Gladstone shrinks with horror. He only maintains that conformity to the
      religion of the state ought to be an indispensable qualification for
      office; and he would, unless we have greatly misunderstood him, think it
      his duty, if he had the power, to revive the Test Act, to enforce it
      rigourously, and to extend it to important classes who were formerly
      exempt from its operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is indeed a legitimate consequence of his principles. But why stop
      here? Why not roast dissenters at slow fires? All the general reasonings
      on which this theory rests evidently lead to sanguinary persecution. If
      the propagation of religious truth be a principal end of government, as
      government; if it be the duty of a government to employ for that end its
      constitutional power; if the constitutional power of governments extends,
      as it most unquestionably does, to the making of laws for the burning of
      heretics; if burning <span class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144"
       id="link144"></a>be, as it most assuredly is, in many cases, a most
      effectual mode of suppressing opinions; why should we not burn? If the
      relation in which government ought to stand to the people be, as Mr.
      Gladstone tells us, a paternal relation, we are irresistibly led to the
      conclusion that persecution is justifiable. For the right of propagating
      opinions by punishment is one which belongs to parents as clearly as the
      right to give instruction. A boy is compelled to attend family worship: he
      is forbidden to read irreligious books: if he will not learn his
      catechism, he is sent to bed without his supper: if he plays truant at
      church-time a task is set him. If he should display the precocity of his
      talents by expressing impious opinions before his brothers and sisters, we
      should not much blame his father for cutting short the controversy with a
      horse-whip. All the reasons which lead us to think that parents are
      peculiarly fitted to conduct the education of their children, and that
      education is a principal end of the parental relation, lead us also to
      think that parents ought to be allowed to use punishment, if necessary,
      for the purpose of forcing children, who are incapable of judging for
      themselves, to receive religious instruction and to attend religious
      worship. Why, then, is this prerogative of punishment, so eminently
      paternal, to be withheld from a paternal government? It seems to us, also,
      to be the height of absurdity to employ civil disabilities for the
      propagation of an opinion, and then to shrink from employing other
      punishments for the same purpose. For nothing can be clearer than that, if
      you punish at all, you ought to punish enough. The pain caused by
      punishment is pure unmixed evil, and never ought to be inflicted, except
      for the sake of some good. It is mere foolish cruelty to provide penalties
      which torment <span class="pagenum">145</span><a name="link145"
       id="link145"></a>the criminal without preventing the crime. Now it is
      possible, by sanguinary persecution unrelentingly inflicted, to suppress
      opinions. In this way the Albigenses were put down. In this way the
      Lollards were put down. In this way the fair promise of the Reformation
      was blighted in Italy and Spain. But we may safely defy Mr. Gladstone to
      point out a single instance in which the system which he recommends has
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why should he be so tender-hearted? What reason can he give for
      hanging a murderer, and suffering an heresiarch to escape without even a
      pecuniary mulct? Is the heresiarch a less pernicious member of society
      than the murderer? Is not the loss of one soul a greater evil than the
      extinction of many lives? And the number of murders committed by the most
      profligate bravo that ever let out his poniard to hire in Italy, or by the
      most savage buccaneer that ever prowled on the Windward Station, is small
      indeed, when compared with the number of souls which have been caught in
      the snares of one dexterous heresiarch. If, then, the heresiarch causes
      infinitely greater evils than the murderer, why is he not as proper an
      object of penal legislation as the murderer? We can give a reason, a
      reason, short, simple, decisive, and consistent. We do not extenuate the
      evil which the heresiarch produces; but we say that it is not evil of that
      sort against which it is the end of government to guard. But how Mr.
      Gladstone, who considers the evil which the heresiarch produces as evil of
      the sort against which it is the end of government to guard, can escape
      from the obvious consequence of his doctrine, we do not understand. The
      world is full of parallel cases. An orange-woman stops up the pavement
      with her wheelbarrow; and a policeman takes her into custody. A miser who
      has <span class="pagenum">146</span><a name="link146" id="link146"></a>amassed
      a million suffers an old friend and benefactor to die in a workhouse, and
      cannot be questioned before any tribunal for his baseness and ingratitude.
      Is this because legislators think the orange-woman&rsquo;s conduct worse than
      the miser&rsquo;s? Not at all. It is because the stopping up of the pathway is
      one of the evils against which it is the business of the public
      authorities to protect society, and heartlessness is not one of those
      evils. It would be the height of folly to say that the miser ought,
      indeed, to be punished, but that he ought to be punished less severely
      than the orange-woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heretical Constantius persecutes Athanasius; and why not? Shall Caesar
      punish the robber who has taken one purse, and spare the wretch who has
      taught millions to rob the Creator of His honour, and to bestow it on the
      creature? The orthodox Theodosius persecutes the Arians, and with equal
      reason. Shall an insult offered to the Caesarean majesty be expiated by
      death; and shall there be no penalty for him who degrades to the rank of a
      creature the almighty, the infinite Creator? We have a short Answer for
      both: &ldquo;To Caesar the things which are Caesar&rsquo;s. Caesar is appointed for
      the punishment of robbers and rebels. He is not appointed for the purpose
      of either propagating or exterminating the doctrine of the
      consubstantiality of the Father and the Son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; says Mr. Gladstone. &ldquo;Caesar is bound in conscience to propagate
      whatever he thinks to be the truth as to this question. Constantius is
      bound to establish the Arian worship throughout the empire, and to
      displace the bravest captains of his legions, and the ablest ministers of
      his treasury, if they hold the Nicene faith. Theodosius is equally bound
      to turn out every public servant whom his Arian predecessors have put in.
      But if <span class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147" id="link147"></a>Constantius
      lays on Athanasius a fine of a single <i>aureus</i>, if Theodosius
      imprisons an Arian presbyter for a week, this is most unjustifiable
      oppression.&rdquo; Our readers will be curious to know how this distinction is
      made out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons which Mr. Gladstone gives against persecution affecting life,
      limb, and property, may be divided into two classes; first, reasons, which
      can be called reasons only by extreme courtesy, and which nothing but the
      most deplorable necessity would ever have induced a man of his abilities
      to use; and, secondly, reasons which are really reasons, and which have so
      much force that they not only completely prove his exception, but
      completely upset his general rule. His artillery on this occasion is
      composed of two sorts of pieces, pieces which will not go off at all, and
      pieces which go off with a vengeance, and recoil with most crushing effect
      upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We, as fallible creatures,&rdquo; says Mr. Gladstone, &ldquo;have no right, from
      any bare speculations of our own, to administer pains and penalties to our
      fellow-creatures, whether on social or religious grounds. We have the
      right to enforce the laws of the land by such pains and penalties, because
      it is expressly given by Him who has declared that the civil rulers are to
      bear the sword for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the encouragement
      of them that do well. And so, in things spiritual, had it pleased God to
      give to the Church or the State this power, to be permanently exercised
      over their members, or mankind at large, we should have the right to use
      it; but it does not appear to have been so received, and consequently, it
      should not be exercised.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We should be sorry to think that the security of our lives and property
      from persecution rested on no better ground than this. Is not a teacher of
      heresy an evildoer? Has not heresy been condemned in many countries, and
      in our own among them, by the laws of the land, <span class="pagenum">148</span><a
      name="link148" id="link148"></a>which, as Mr. Gladstone says, it is
      justifiable to enforce by penal sanctions? If a heretic is not specially
      mentioned in the text to which Mr. Gladstone refers, neither is an
      assassin, a kidnapper, or a highwayman: and if the silence of the New
      Testament as to all interference of governments to stop the progress of
      heresy be a reason for not fining or imprisoning heretics, it is surely
      just as good a reason for not excluding them from office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>God,&rdquo; says Mr. Gladstone, &ldquo;has seen fit to authorise the employment of
      force in the one case and not in the other; for it was with regard to
      chastisement inflicted by the sword for an insult offered to himself that
      the Redeemer declared his kingdom not to be of this world;&mdash;meaning,
      apparently in an especial manner, that it should be otherwise than after
      this world&rsquo;s fashion, in respect to the sanctions by which its laws should
      be maintained</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now here Mr. Gladstone, quoting from memory, has fallen into an error. The
      very remarkable words which he cites do not appear to have had any
      reference to the wound inflicted by Peter on Malchus. They were addressed
      to Pilate, in answer to the question, &ldquo;Art thou the King of the Jews?&rdquo; We
      cannot help saying that we are surprised that Mr. Gladstone should not
      have more accurately verified a quotation on which, according to him,
      principally depends the right of a hundred millions of his
      fellow-subjects, idolaters, Mussulmans, Catholics, and dissenters, to
      their property, their liberty, and their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s humane interpretations of Scripture are lamentably
      destitute of one recommendation, which he considers as of the highest
      value: they are by no means in accordance with the general precepts or
      practice of the Church, from the time when the Christians became strong
      enough to persecute down to a very recent period. A dogma favourable to
      toleration is <span class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149"
       id="link149"></a>certainly not a dogma <i>quod semper, quod ubique, quod
      omnibus</i>. Bossuet was able to say, we fear with too much truth, that on
      one point all Christians had long been unanimous, the right of the civil
      magistrate to propagate truth by the sword; that even heretics had been
      orthodox as to this right, and that the Anabaptists and Socinians were the
      first who called it in question. We will not pretend to say what is the
      best explanation of the text under consideration; but we are sure that Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s is the worst. According to him, government ought to exclude
      dissenters from office, but not to fine them, because Christ&rsquo;s kingdom is
      not of this world. We do not see why the line may not be drawn at a
      hundred other places as well as that which he has chosen. We do not see
      why Lord Clarendon, in recommending the act of 1664 against conventicles,
      might not have said, &ldquo;It hath been thought by some that this classis of
      men might with advantage be not only imprisoned but pilloried. But
      methinks, my Lords, we are inhibited from the punishment of the pillory by
      that Scripture, &lsquo;My kingdom is not of this world.&rsquo;&rdquo; Archbishop Laud, when
      he sate on Burton in the Star-Chamber, might have said, &ldquo;I pronounce for
      the pillory; and, indeed, I could wish that all such wretches were
      delivered to the fire, but that our Lord hath said that his kingdom is not
      of this world.&rdquo; And Gardiner might have written to the Sheriff of
      Oxfordshire; &ldquo;See that execution be done without fail on Master Ridley and
      Master Latimer, as you will answer the same to the Queen&rsquo;s grace at your
      peril. But if they shall desire to have some gunpowder for the shortening
      of their torment, I see not but you may grant it, as it is written, <i>Regnum
      meam non est de hoc mundo</i>; that is to say, My kingdom is not of this
      world.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">150</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>But
      Mr. Gladstone has other arguments against persecution, arguments which are
      of so much weight, that they are decisive not only against persecution but
      against his whole theory. &ldquo;The government,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is incompetent to
      exercise minute and constant supervision over religious opinion.&rdquo; And
      hence he infers, that &ldquo;a government exceeds its province when it comes to
      adapt a scale of punishments to variations in religious opinion, according
      to their respective degrees of variation from the established creed. To
      decline affording countenance to sects is a single and simple rule. To
      punish their professors, according to their several errors, even were
      there no other objection is one for which the state must assume functions
      wholly ecclesiastical, and for which it is not intrinsically fitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is, in our opinion, quite true. But how does it agree with Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s theory? What! the government incompetent to exercise even such
      a degree of supervision over religious opinion as is implied by the
      punishment of the most deadly heresy! The government incompetent to
      measure even the grossest deviations from the standard of truth! The
      government not intrinsically qualified to judge of the comparative
      enormity of any theological errors! The government so ignorant on these
      subjects, that it is compelled to leave, not merely subtle heresies,
      discernible only by the eye of a Cyril or a Bucer, but Socinianism, Deism,
      Mahometanism, Idolatry, Atheism, unpunished! To whom does Mr. Gladstone
      assign the office of selecting a religion for the state, from among
      hundreds of religions, every one of which lays claim to truth? Even to
      this same government, which is now pronounced to be so unfit for
      theological investigations <span class="pagenum">151</span><a
      name="link151" id="link151"></a>that it cannot venture to punish a man for
      worshipping a lump of stone with a score of heads and hands. We do not
      remember ever to have fallen in with a more extraordinary instance of
      inconsistency. When Mr. Gladstone wishes to prove that the government
      ought to establish and endow a religion, and to fence it with a Test Act,
      government is [Greek] in the moral world. Those who would confine it to
      secular ends take a low view of its nature. A religion must be attached to
      its agency; and this religion must be that of the conscience of the
      governor, or none. It is for the Governor to decide between Papists and
      Protestants, Jansenists and Molinists, Arminians and Calvinists,
      Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Sabellians and Tritheists, Homoousians
      and Homoiousians, Nestorians and Eutychians, Monothelites and
      Monophysites, Pædobaptists and Anabaptists. It is for him to rejudge the
      Acts of Nice and Rimini, of Ephesus and Chalcedon, of Constantinople and
      St. John Lateran, of Trent and Dort. It is for him to arbitrate between
      the Greek and the Latin procession, and to determine whether that
      mysterious filioque shall or shall not have a place in the national creed.
      When he has made up his mind, he is to tax the whole community in order to
      pay people to teach his opinion, whatever it may be. He is to rely on his
      own judgment, though it may be opposed to that of nine-tenths of the
      society. He is to act on his own judgment, at the risk of exciting the
      most formidable discontents. He is to inflict, perhaps on a great majority
      of the population, what, whether we choose to call it persecution or not,
      will always be felt as persecution by those who suffer it. He is, on
      account of differences often too slight for vulgar comprehension, to <span
      class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a>deprive the
      state of the services of the ablest men. He is to debase and enfeeble the
      community which he governs, from a nation into a sect. In our own country,
      for example, millions of Catholics, millions of Protestant Dissenters, are
      to be excluded from all power and honours. A great hostile fleet is on the
      sea; but Nelson is not to command in the Channel if in the mystery of the
      Trinity he confounds the persons. An invading army has landed in Kent; but
      the Duke of Wellington is not to be at the head of our forces if he
      divides the substance. And after all this, Mr. Gladstone tells us, that it
      would be wrong to imprison a Jew, a Mussulman, or a Budhist, for a day;
      because really a government cannot understand these matters, and ought not
      to meddle with questions which belong to the Church. A singular
      theologian, indeed, this government! So learned that it is competent to
      exclude Grotius from office for being a Semi-Pelagian, so unlearned that
      it is incompetent to fine a Hindoo peasant a rupee for going on a
      pilgrimage to Juggernaut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>To solicit and persuade one another,&rdquo; says Mr. Gladstone, &ldquo;are
      privileges which belong to us all; and the wiser and better man is bound
      to advise the less wise and good: but he is not only not bound, he is not
      allowed, speaking generally, to coerce him. It is untrue, then, that the
      same considerations which bind a government to submit a religion to the
      free choice of the people would therefore justify their enforcing its
      adoption.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Granted. But it is true that all the same considerations which would
      justify a government in propagating a religion by means of civil
      disabilities would justify the propagating of that religion by penal laws.
      To solicit! Is it solicitation to tell a Catholic Duke, that he must
      abjure his religion or walk out of the <span class="pagenum">153</span><a
      name="link153" id="link153"></a>House of Lords? To persuade! Is it
      persuasion to tell a banister of distinguished eloquence and learning that
      he shall grow old in the stuff gown, while his pupils are seated above him
      in ermine, because he cannot digest the damnatory clauses of the
      Athanasian creed? Would Mr. Gladstone think that a religious system which
      he considers as false, Socinian for example, was submitted to his free
      choice, if it were submitted in these terms?&mdash;&ldquo;If you obstinately
      adhere to the faith of the Nicene fathers, you shall not be burned in
      Smithfield; you shall not be sent to Dorchester gaol; you shall not even
      pay double land-tax. But you shall be shut out from all situations in
      which you might exercise your talents with honour to yourself and
      advantage to the country. The House of Commons, the bench of magistracy,
      are not for such as you. You shall see younger men, your inferiors in
      station and talents, rise to the highest dignities and attract the gaze of
      nations, while you are doomed to neglect and obscurity. If you have a son
      of the highest promise, a son such as other fathers would contemplate with
      delight, the development of his fine talents and of his generous ambition
      shall be a torture to you. You shall look on him as a being doomed to
      lead, as you have led, the abject life of a Roman or a Neapolitan in the
      midst of the great English people. All those high honours, so much more
      precious than the most costly gifts of despots, with which a free country
      decorates its illustrious citizens, shall be to him, as they have been to
      you, objects not of hope and virtuous emulation, but of hopeless, envious
      pining. Educate him, if you wish him to feel his degradation. Educate him,
      if you wish to stimulate his craving for what he never must enjoy. Educate
      him, if you would imitate the barbarity of that Celtic tyrant, <span
      class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154" id="link154"></a>who fed his
      prisoners on salted food till they called eagerly for drink, and then let
      down an empty cup into the dungeon, and left them to die of thirst.&rdquo; Is
      this to solicit, to persuade, to submit religion to the free choice of
      man? Would a fine of a thousand pounds, would imprisonment in Newgate for
      six months, under circumstances not disgraceful, give Mr. Gladstone the
      pain which he would feel, if he were to be told that he was to be dealt
      with in the way in which he would himself deal with more than one half of
      his countrymen?
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not at all surprised to find such inconsistency even in a man of
      Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s talents. The truth is, that every man is, to a great
      extent, the creature of the age. It is to no purpose that he resists the
      influence which the vast mass, in which he is but an atom, must exercise
      on him. He may try to be a man of the tenth century: but he cannot.
      Whether he will or not, he must be a man of the nineteenth century. He
      shares in the motion of the moral as well as in that of the physical
      world. He can no more be as intolerant as he would have been in the days
      of the Tudors than he can stand in the evening exactly where he stood in
      the morning. The globe goes round from west to east; and he must go round
      with it. When he says that he is where he was, he means only that he has
      moved at the same rate with all around him. When he says that he has gone
      a good way to the westward, he means only that he has not gone to the
      eastward quite as rapidly as his neighbors. Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s book is, in
      this respect, a very gratifying performance. It is the measure of what a
      man can do to be left behind by the world. It is the strenuous effort of a
      very vigorous mind to keep as far in the rear of the general progress as
      possible. And yet, with the <span class="pagenum">155</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>most intense exertion, Mr. Gladstone
      cannot help being, on some important points, greatly in advance of Locke
      himself; and with whatever admiration he may regard Laud, it is well for
      him, we can tell him, that he did not write in the days of that zealous
      primate, who would certainly have refuted the expositions of Scripture
      which we have quoted, by one of the keenest arguments that can be
      addressed to human ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the only instance in which Mr. Gladstone has shrunk in a very
      remarkable manner from the consequences of his own theory. If there be in
      the whole world a state to which this theory is applicable, that state is
      the British Empire in India. Even we, who detest paternal governments in
      general, shall admit that the duties of the government of India, are, to a
      considerable extent, paternal. There, the superiority of the governors to
      the governed in moral science is unquestionable. The conversion of the
      whole people to the worst form that Christianity ever wore in the darkest
      ages would be a most happy event. It is not necessary that a man should be
      a Christian to wish for the propagation of Christianity in India. It is
      sufficient that he should be an European not much below the ordinary
      European level of good sense and humanity. Compared with the importance of
      the interests at stake, all those Scotch and Irish questions which occupy
      so large a portion of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s book, sink into insignificance. In
      no part of the world since the days of Theodosius has so large a heathen
      population been subject to a Christian government. In no part of the world
      is heathenism more cruel, more licentious, more fruitful of absurd rites
      and pernicious laws. Surely, if it be the duty of government to use its
      power and its revenue in order to bring seven millions of Irish Catholics
      <span class="pagenum">156</span><a name="link156" id="link156"></a>over to
      the Protestant Church, it is <i>a fortiori</i> the duty of the government
      to use its power and its revenue in order to make seventy millions of
      idolaters Christians. If it he a sin to suffer John Howard or William Penn
      to hold any office in England because they are not in communion with the
      Established Church, it must be a crying sin indeed to admit to high
      situations men who bow down, in temples covered with emblems of vice, to
      the hideous images of sensual or malevolent gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no. Orthodoxy, it seems, is more shocked by the priests of Rome than
      by the priests of Kalee. The plain red brick building, the Cave of
      Adullam, or Ebenezer Chapel, where uneducated men hear a half-educated man
      talk of the Christian law of love and the Christian hope of glory, is
      unworthy of the indulgence which is reserved for the shrine where the Thug
      suspends a portion of the spoils of murdered travellers, and for the car
      which grinds its way through the bones of self-immolated pilgrims. &ldquo;It
      would be,&rdquo; says Mr. Gladstone, &ldquo;an absurd exaggeration to maintain it as
      the part of such a government as that of the British in India to bring
      home to the door of every subject at once the ministrations of a new and
      totally unknown religion.&rdquo; The government ought indeed to desire to
      propagate Christianity. But the extent to which they must do so must be
      &ldquo;limited by the degree in which the people are found willing to receive
      it.&rdquo; He proposes no such limitation in the case of Ireland. He would give
      the Irish a Protestant Church whether they like it or not. &ldquo;We believe,&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;that that which we place before them is, whether they know it or
      not, calculated to be beneficial to them; and that, if they know it not
      now, they will, know it when it is presented to them fairly. Shall we,
      then, purchase their applause at the <span class="pagenum">157</span><a
      name="link157" id="link157"></a>expense of their substantial, nay, their
      spiritual interests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And why does Mr. Gladstone allow to the Hindoo a privilege which he denies
      to the Irishman? Why does he reserve his greatest liberality for the most
      monstrous errors? Why does he pay most respect to the opinion of the least
      enlightened people? Why does he withhold the right to exercise paternal
      authority from that one government which is fitter to exercise paternal
      authority than any government that ever existed in the world? We will give
      the reason in his own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In British India,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a small number of persons advanced to a
      higher grade of civilization, exercise the powers of government over an
      immensely greater number of less cultivated persons, not by coercion, but
      under free stipulation with the governed. Now, the rights of a government,
      in circumstances thus peculiar, obviously depend neither upon the
      unrestricted theory of paternal principles, nor upon any primordial or
      fictitious contract of indefinite powers, but upon an express and known
      treaty, matter of positive agreement, not of natural ordinance.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where Mr. Gladstone has seen this treaty we cannot guess; for, though he
      calls it a &ldquo;known treaty,&rdquo; we will stake our credit that it is quite
      unknown both at Calcutta and Madras, both in Leadenhall Street and Cannon
      Row, that it is not to be found in any of the enormous folios of papers
      relating to India which fill the book-cases of members of Parliament, that
      it has utterly escaped the researches of all the historians of our Eastern
      empire, that, in the long and interesting debates of 1813 on the admission
      of missionaries to India, debates of which the most valuable part has been
      excellently preserved by the care of the speakers, no allusion to this
      important instrument is to be found. <span class="pagenum">158</span><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a>The truth is that this treaty is a
      nonentity. It is by coercion, it is by the sword, and not by free
      stipulation with the governed, that England rules India; nor is England
      bound by any contract whatever not to deal with Bengal as she deals with
      Ireland. She may set up a Bishop of Patna, and a Dean of Hoogley; she may
      grant away the public revenue for the maintenance of prebendaries of
      Benares and canons of Moorshedabad; she may divide the country into
      parishes, and place a rector with a stipend in every one of them; and all
      this without infringing any positive agreement. If there be such a treaty,
      Mr. Gladstone can have no difficulty in making known its date, its terms,
      and, above all, the precise extent of the territory within which we have
      sinfully bound ourselves to be guilty of practical atheism. The last point
      is of great importance. For, as the provinces of our Indian empire were
      acquired at different times, and in very different ways, no single treaty,
      indeed no ten treaties, will justify the system pursued by our government
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain state of the case is this. No man in his senses would dream of
      applying Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s theory to India; because, if so applied, it would
      inevitably destroy our empire; and, with our empire, the best chance of
      spreading Christianity among the natives. This Mr. Gladstone felt. In some
      way or other his theory was to be saved, and the monstrous consequences
      avoided. Of intentional misrepresentation we are quite sure that he is
      incapable. But we cannot acquit him of that unconscious disingenuousness
      from which the most upright man, when strongly attached to an opinion, is
      seldom wholly free. We believe that he recoiled from the ruinous
      consequences which his system would produce, if tried in India; but that
      he did not like to <span class="pagenum">159</span><a name="link159"
       id="link159"></a>say so, lest he should lay himself open to the charge of
      sacrificing principle to expediency, a word which is held in the utmost
      abhorrence by all his school. Accordingly, he caught at the notion of a
      treaty, a notion which must, we think, have originated in some rhetorical
      expression which he has imperfectly understood. There is one excellent way
      of avoiding the drawing of a false conclusion from a false major; and that
      is by having a false minor. Inaccurate history is an admirable corrective
      of unreasonable theory. And thus it is in the present case. A bad general
      rule is laid down, and obstinately maintained, wherever the consequences
      are not too monstrous for human bigotry. But when they become so horrible
      that even Christ Church shrinks, that even Oriel stands aghast, the rule
      is evaded by means of a fictitious contract. One imaginary obligation is
      set up against another. Mr. Gladstone first preaches to governments the
      duty of undertaking an enterprise just as rational as the Crusades, and
      then dispenses them from it on the ground of a treaty which is just as
      authentic as the donation of Constantine to Pope Sylvester. His system
      resembles nothing so much as a forged bond with a forged release indorsed
      on the back of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With more show of reason he rests the claim of the Scotch Church on a
      contract. He considers that contract, however, as most unjustifiable, and
      speaks of the setting up of the Kirk as a disgraceful blot on the reign of
      William the Third. Surely it would be amusing, if it were not melancholy,
      to see a man of virtue and abilities unsatisfied with the calamities which
      one Church, constituted on false principles, has brought upon the empire,
      and repining that Scotland is not in the same state with Ireland, that no
      Scottish agitator is <span class="pagenum">160</span><a name="link160"
       id="link160"></a>raising rent and putting county members in and out, that
      no Presbyterian association is dividing supreme power with the government,
      that no meetings of precursors and repealers are covering the side of the
      Calton Hill, that twenty-five thousand troops are not required to maintain
      order on the north of the Tweed, that the anniversary of the Battle of
      Bothwell Bridge is not regularly celebrated by insult, riot, and murder.
      We could hardly find a stronger argument against Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s system
      than that which Scotland furnishes. The policy which has been followed in
      that country has been directly opposed to the policy which he recommends.
      And the consequence is that Scotland, having been one of the rudest, one
      of the poorest, one of the most turbulent countries in Europe, has become
      one of the most highly civilised, one of the most flourishing, one of the
      most tranquil. The atrocities which were of common occurrence while an
      unpopular church was dominant are unknown. In spite of a mutual aversion
      as bitter as ever separated one people from another, the two kingdoms
      which compose our island have been indissolubly joined together. Of the
      ancient national feeling there remains just enough to be ornamental and
      useful; just enough to inspire the poet, and to kindle a generous and
      friendly emulation in the bosom of the soldier. But for all the ends of
      government the nations are one. And why are they so? The answer is simple.
      The nations are one for all the ends of government, because in their union
      the true ends of government alone were kept in sight. The nations are one
      because the Churches are two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the union of England with Scotland, an union which resembles the
      union of the limbs of one healthful and vigorous body, all moved by one
      will, <span class="pagenum">161</span><a name="link161" id="link161"></a>all
      co-operating for common ends. The system of Mr. Gladstone would have
      produced an union which can be compared only to that which is the subject
      of a wild Persian fable. King Zohak&mdash;we tell the story as Mr. Southey
      tells it to us&mdash;gave the devil leave to kiss his shoulders. Instantly
      two serpents sprang out, who, in the fury of hunger, attacked his head,
      and attempted to get at his brain. Zohak pulled them away, and tore them
      with his nails. But he found that they were inseparable parts of himself,
      and that what he was lacerating was his own flesh. Perhaps we might be
      able to find, if we looked round the world, some political union like
      this, some hideous monster of a state, cursed with one principle of
      sensation and two principles of volition, self-loathing and
      self-torturing, made up of parts which are driven by a frantic impulse to
      inflict mutual pain, yet are doomed to feel whatever they inflict, which
      are divided by an irreconcilable hatred, yet are blended in an
      indissoluble identity. Mr. Gladstone, from his tender concern for Zohak,
      is unsatisfied because the devil has as yet kissed only one shoulder,
      because there is not a snake mangling and mangled on the left to keep in
      countenance his brother on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must proceed in our examination of his theory. Having, as he
      conceives, proved that it is the duty of every government to profess some
      religion or other, right or wrong, and to establish that religion, he then
      comes to the question what religion a government ought to prefer; and he
      decides this question in favour of the form of Christianity established in
      England. The Church of England is, according to him, the pure Catholic
      Church of Christ, which possesses the apostolical succession of ministers,
      and within <span class="pagenum">162</span><a name="link162" id="link162"></a>whose
      pale is to be found that unity which is essential to truth. For her
      decisions he claims a degree of reverence far beyond what she has ever, in
      any of her formularies, claimed for herself; far beyond what the moderate
      school of Bossuet demands for the Pope; and scarcely short of what that
      school would ascribe to Pope and General Council together. To separate
      from her communion is schism. To reject her traditions or interpretations
      of Scripture is sinful presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone pronounces the right of private judgment, as it is generally
      understood throughout Protestant Europe, to be a monstrous abuse. He
      declares himself favourable, indeed, to the exercise of private judgment,
      after a fashion of his own. We have, according to him, a right to judge
      all the doctrines of the Church of England to be sound, but not to judge
      any of them to be unsound. He has no objection, he assures us, to active
      inquiries into religious questions. On the contrary, he thinks such
      inquiry highly desirable, as long as it does not lead to diversity of
      opinion; which is much the same thing as if he were to recommend the use
      of fire that will not burn down houses, or of brandy that will not make
      men drunk. He conceives it to be perfectly possible for mankind to
      exercise their intellects vigorously and freely on theological subjects,
      and yet to come to exactly the same conclusions with each other and with
      the Church of England. And for this opinion he gives, as far as we have
      been able to discover, no reason whatever, except that everybody who
      vigorously and freely exercises his understanding on Euclid&rsquo;s Theorems
      assents to them. &ldquo;The activity of private judgment,&rdquo; he truly observes,
      &ldquo;and the unity and strength of conviction in mathematics <span
      class="pagenum">163</span><a name="link163" id="link163"></a>vary directly
      as each other.&rdquo; On this unquestionable fact he constructs a somewhat
      questionable argument. Everybody who freely inquires agrees, he says, with
      Euclid. But the Church is as much in the right as Euclid. Why, then,
      should not every free inquirer agree with the Church? We could put many
      similar questions. Either the affirmative or the negative of the
      proposition that King Charles wrote the <i>Icon Basilike</i> is as true as
      that two sides of a triangle are greater than the third side. Why, then,
      do Dr. Wordsworth and Mr. Hallam agree in thinking two sides of a triangle
      greater than the third side, and yet differ about the genuineness of the
      <i>Icon Basilike</i>? The state of the exact sciences proves, says Mr.
      Gladstone, that, as respects religion &ldquo;the association of these two ideas,
      activity of inquiry, and variety of conclusion, is a fallacious one.&rdquo; We
      might just as well turn the argument the other way, and infer from the
      variety of religious opinions that there must necessarily be hostile
      mathematical sects, some affirming, and some denying, that the square of
      the hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the sides. But we do not think
      either the one analogy or the other of the smallest value. Our way of
      ascertaining the tendency of free inquiry is simply to open our eyes and
      look at the world in which we live; and there we see that free inquiry on
      mathematical subjects produces unity, and that free inquiry on moral
      subjects produces discrepancy. There would undoubtedly be less discrepancy
      if inquirers were more diligent and candid. But discrepancy there will be
      among the most diligent and candid, as long as the constitution of the
      human mind, and the nature of moral evidence, continue unchanged. That we
      have not freedom and unity together is a very sad thing; and so it is that
      we have <span class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164" id="link164"></a>not
      wings. But we are just as likely to see the one defect removed as the
      other. It is not only in religion that this discrepancy is found. It is
      the same with all matters which depend on moral evidence, with judicial
      questions, for example, and with political questions. All the judges will
      work a sum in the rule of three on the same principle, and bring out the
      same conclusion. But it does not follow that, however honest and laborious
      they may be, they will all be of one mind on the Douglas case. So it is
      vain to hope that there may be a free constitution under which every
      representative will be unanimously elected, and every law unanimously
      passed; and it would be ridiculous for a statesman to stand wondering and
      bemoaning himself because people who agree in thinking that two and two
      make four cannot agree about the new poor law, or the administration of
      Canada.

      There are two intelligible and consistent courses which may be followed
      with respect to the exercise of private judgment; the course of the
      Romanist, who interdicts private judgment because of its inevitable
      inconveniences; and the course of the Protestant, who permits private
      judgment in spite of its inevitable inconveniences. Both are more
      reasonable than Mr. Gladstone, who would have private judgment without its
      inevitable inconveniences. The Romanist produces repose by means of
      stupefaction. The Protestant encourages activity, though he knows that
      where there is much activity there will be some aberration. Mr. Gladstone
      wishes for the unity of the fifteenth century with the active and
      searching spirit of the sixteenth. He might as well wish to be in two
      places at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Gladstone says that we &ldquo;actually require discrepancy of opinion&mdash;require
      and demand error, <span class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165"
       id="link165"></a>falsehood, blindness, and plume ourselves on such
      discrepancy as attesting a freedom which is only valuable when used for
      unity in the truth,&rdquo; he expresses himself with more energy than precision.
      Nobody loves discrepancy for the sake of discrepancy. But a person who
      conscientiously believes that free inquiry is, on the whole, beneficial to
      the interests of truth, and that, from the imperfection of the human
      faculties, wherever there is much free inquiry there will be some
      discrepancy, may, without impropriety, consider such discrepancy, though
      in itself an evil, as a sign of good. That there are ten thousand thieves
      in London, is a very melancholy fact. But, looked at in one point of view,
      it is a reason for exultation. For what other city could maintain ten
      thousand thieves? What must be the mass of wealth, where the fragments
      gleaned by lawless pilfering rise to so large an amount? St. Kilda would
      not support a single pickpocket. The quantity of theft is, to a certain
      extent, an index of the quantity of useful industry and judicious
      speculation. And just as we may, from the great number of rogues in a
      town, infer that much honest gain is made there; so may we often, from the
      quantity of error in a community, draw a cheering inference as to the
      degree in which the public mind is turned to those inquiries which alone
      can lead to rational convictions of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone seems to imagine that most Protestants think it possible for
      the same doctrine to be at once true and false; or that they think it
      immaterial whether, on a religious question, a man comes to a true or a
      false conclusion. If there be any Protestants who hold notions so absurd,
      we abandon them to his censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protestant doctrine touching the right of private <span class="pagenum">166</span><a
      name="link166" id="link166"></a>judgment, that doctrine which is the
      common foundation of the Anglican, the Lutheran, and the Calvinistic
      Churches, that doctrine by which every sect of dissenters vindicates its
      separation, we conceive not to be this, that opposite doctrines may both
      be true; nor this, that truth and falsehood are both equally good; nor yet
      this, that all speculative error is necessarily innocent; but this, that
      there is on the face of the earth no visible body to whose decrees men are
      bound to submit their private judgment on points of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there always such a visible body? Was there such a visible body in the
      year 1500? If not, why are we to believe that there is such a body in the
      year 1839? If there was such a body in the year 1500, what was it? Was it
      the Church of Rome? And how can the Church of England be orthodox now if
      the Church of Rome was orthodox then?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England,&rdquo; says Mr. Gladstone, &ldquo;the case was widely different from that
      of the Continent. Her reformation did not destroy, but successfully
      maintained the unity and succession of the Church in her apostolical
      ministry. We have, therefore, still among us the ordained hereditary
      witnesses of the truth, conveying it to us through an unbroken series from
      our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles. This is to us the ordinary voice
      of authority; of authority equally reasonable and equally true, whether we
      will hear, or whether we will forbear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reasoning is not so clear as might be desired. We have
      among us, he says, ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, and their
      voice is to us the voice of authority. Undoubtedly, if they are witnesses
      of the truth, their voice is the voice of authority. Rut this is little
      more than saying that the truth is the <span class="pagenum">167</span><a
      name="link167" id="link167"></a>truth. Nor is truth more true because it
      comes in an unbroken series from the Apostles. The Nicene faith is not
      more true in the mouth of the Archbishop of Canterbury, than in that of a
      moderator of the General Assembly. If our respect for the authority of the
      Church is to be only consequent upon our conviction of the truth of her
      doctrines, we come at once to that monstrous abuse, the Protestant
      exercise of private judgment. But if Mr. Gladstone means that we ought to
      believe that the Church of England speaks the truth because she has the
      apostolical succession, we greatly doubt whether such a doctrine can be
      maintained. In the first place, what proof have we of the fact? We have,
      indeed, heard it said that Providence would certainly have interfered to
      preserve the apostolical succession in the true Church. But this is an
      argument fitted for understandings of a different kind from Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s. He will hardly tell us that the Church of England is the true
      Church because she has the succession; and that she has the succession
      because she is the true Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      What evidence, then, have we for the fact of the apostolical succession?
      And here we may easily defend the truth against Oxford with the same
      arguments with which, in old times, the truth was defended by Oxford
      against Rome. In this stage of our combat with Mr. Gladstone, we need few
      weapons except those which we find in the well-furnished and well-ordered
      armoury of Chillingworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transmission of orders from the Apostles to an English clergyman of
      the present day must have been through a very great number of intermediate
      persons. Now, it is probable that no clergyman in the Church of England
      can trace up his spiritual genealogy from <span class="pagenum">168</span><a
      name="link168" id="link168"></a>bishop to bishop so far back as the time
      of the Conquest. There remain many centuries during which the history of
      the transmission of his orders is buried in utter darkness. And whether he
      be a priest by succession from the Apostles depends on the question,
      whether during that long period, some thousands of events took place, any
      one of which may, without any gross improbability, be supposed not to have
      taken place. We have not a tittle of evidence for any one of these events.
      We do not even know the names or countries of the men to whom it is taken
      for granted that these events happened. We do not know whether the
      spiritual ancestors of any one of our contemporaries were Spanish or
      Armenian, Arian or Orthodox. In the utter absence of all particular
      evidence, we are surely entitled to require that there should be very
      strong evidence indeed that the strictest regularity was observed in every
      generation, and that episcopal functions were exercised by none who were
      not bishops by succession from the Apostles. But we have no such evidence.
      In the first place, we have not full and accurate information touching the
      polity of the Church during the century which followed the persecution of
      Nero. That, during this period, the overseers of all the little Christian
      societies scattered through the Roman empire, held their spiritual
      authority by virtue of holy orders derived from the Apostles, cannot be
      proved by contemporary testimony, or by any testimony which can be
      regarded as decisive. The question, whether the primitive ecclesiastical
      constitution bore a greater resemblance to the Anglican or to the
      Calvinistic model has been fiercely disputed. It is a question on which
      men of eminent parts, learning, and piety have differed, and do to this
      day differ <span class="pagenum">160</span><a name="link160" id="link160_"></a>very
      widely. It is a question on which at least a full half of the ability and
      erudition of Protestant Europe has, ever since the Reformation, been
      opposed to the Anglican pretensions. Mr. Gladstone himself, we are
      persuaded, would have the candour to allow that, if no evidence were
      admitted but that which is furnished by the genuine Christian literature
      of the first two centuries, judgment would not go in favour of prelacy.
      And if he looked at the subject as calmly as he would look at a
      controversy respecting the Roman Comitia or the Anglo-Saxon Wittenagemote,
      he would probably think that the absence of contemporary evidence during
      so long a period was a defect which later attestations, however numerous,
      could but very imperfectly supply. It is surely impolitic to rest the
      doctrines of the English Church on a historical theory which, to
      ninety-nine Protestants out of a hundred, would seem much more
      questionable than any of those doctrines. Nor is this all. Extreme
      obscurity overhangs the history of the middle ages; and the facts which
      are discernible through that obscurity prove that the Church was
      exceedingly ill-regulated. We read of sees of the highest dignity openly
      sold, transferred backwards and forwards by popular tumult, bestowed
      sometimes by a profligate woman on her paramour, sometimes by a warlike
      baron on a kinsman still a stripling. We read of bishops of ten years old,
      of bishops of five years old, of many popes who were mere boys, and who
      rivalled the frantic dissoluteness of Caligula, nay, of a female pope. And
      though this last story, once believed throughout all Europe, has been
      disproved by the strict researches of modern criticism, the most
      discerning of those who reject it have admitted that it is not
      intrinsically improbable. In <span class="pagenum">170</span><a
      name="link170" id="link170"></a>our own island, it was the complaint of
      Alfred that not a single priest south of the Thames, and very few on the
      north, could read either Latin or English. And this illiterate clergy
      exercised their ministry amidst a rude and half-heathen population, in
      which Danish pirates, unchristened, or christened by the hundred on a
      field of battle, were mingled with a Saxon peasantry scarcely better
      instructed in religion. The state of Ireland was still worse. &ldquo;Tota ilia
      per universam Hiberniam dissolutio ecclesiasticæ disciplinas, illa ubique
      pro consuetudine Christiana sæva subintroducta barbaries,&rdquo; are the
      expressions of St. Bernard. We are, therefore, at a loss to conceive how
      any clergyman can feel confident that his orders have come down correctly.
      Whether he be really a successor of the Apostles depends on an immense
      number of such contingencies as these; whether, under King Ethelwolf, a
      stupid priest might not, while baptizing several scores of Danish
      prisoners who had just made their option between the font and the gallows,
      inadvertently omit to perform the rite on one of these graceless
      proselytes; whether, in the seventh century, an impostor, who had never
      received consecration, might not have passed himself off as a bishop on a
      rude tribe of Scots; whether a lad of twelve did really, by a ceremony
      huddled over when he was too drunk to know what he was about, convey the
      episcopal character to a lad of ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the first century, not less, in all probability, than a hundred
      thousand persons have exercised the functions of bishops. That many of
      these have not been bishops by apostolical succession is quite certain.
      Hooker admits that deviations from the general rule have been frequent,
      and with a boldness worthy of <span class="pagenum">171</span><a
      name="link171" id="link171"></a>his high and statesmanlike intellect,
      pronounces them to have been often justifiable. &ldquo;There may be,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;sometimes very just and sufficient reason to allow ordination made
      without a bishop. Where the Church must needs have some ordained, and
      neither hath nor can have possibly a bishop to ordain, in case of such
      necessity the ordinary institution of God hath given <i>oftentimes</i>,
      and may give place. And therefore we are not simply without exception to
      urge a lineal descent of power from the Apostles by continued succession
      of bishops in every effectual ordination.&rdquo; There can be little doubt, we
      think, that the succession, if it ever existed, has often been interrupted
      in ways much less respectable. For example, let us suppose, and we are
      sure that no well-informed person will think the supposition by any means
      improbable, that, in the third century, a man of no principle and some
      parts, who has, in the course of a roving and discreditable life, been a
      catechumen at Antioch, and has there become familiar with Christian usages
      and doctrines, afterwards rambles to Marseilles, where he finds a
      Christian society, rich, liberal, and simple-hearted. He pretends to be a
      Christian, attracts notice by his abilities and affected zeal, and is
      raised to the episcopal dignity without having ever, been baptized. That
      such an event might happen, nay, was very likely to happen, cannot well be
      disputed by any one who has read the Life of Peregrinus. The very virtues,
      indeed, which distinguished the early Christians, seem to have laid them
      open to those arts which deceived <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;Uriel,
      though Regent of the Sun, and held <br /><span class="indent20">The
      sharpest-sighted spirit of all in Heaven.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this unbaptized impostor is evidently no successor <span
      class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a>of the
      Apostles. He is not even a Christian and all orders derived through such a
      pretended bishop are altogether invalid. Do we know enough of the state of
      the world and of the Church in the third century to be able to say with
      confidence that there were not at that time twenty such pretended bishops?
      Every such case makes a break in the apostolical succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, suppose that a break, such as Hooker admits to have been both common
      and justifiable, or such as we have supposed to be produced by hypocrisy
      and cupidity, were found in the chain which connected the Apostles with
      any of the missionaries who first spread Christianity in the wilder parts
      of Europe, who can say how extensive the effect of this single break may
      be? Suppose that St. Patrick, for example, if ever there was such a man,
      or Theodore of Tarsus, who is said to have consecrated in the seventh
      century the first bishops of many English sees, had not the true
      apostolical orders, is it not conceivable that such a circumstance may
      affect the orders of many clergymen now living? Even if it were possible,
      which it assuredly is not, to prove that the Church had the apostolical
      orders in the third century, it would be impossible to prove that those
      orders were not in the twelfth century so far lost that no ecclesiastic
      could be certain of the legitimate descent of his own spiritual character.
      And if this were so, no subsequent precautions could repair the evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chillingworth states the conclusion at which he had arrived on this
      subject in these very remarkable words: &ldquo;That of ten thousand probables no
      one should be false; that of ten thousand requisites, whereof any one may
      fail, not one should be wanting, this to me is extremely <span
      class="pagenum">173</span><a name="link173" id="link173"></a>improbable,
      and even cousin-german to impossible. So that the assurance hereof is like
      a machine composed of an innumerable multitude of pieces, of which it is
      strangely unlikely but some will be out of order; and yet, if any one be
      so, the whole fabric falls of necessity to the ground: and he that shall
      put them together, and maturely consider all the possible ways of lapsing
      and nullifying a priesthood in the Church of Rome, will be very inclinable
      to think that it is a hundred to one, that among a hundred seeming
      priests, there is not one true one; nay, that it is not a thing very
      improbable that, amongst those many millions which make up the Romish
      hierarchy, there are not twenty true.&rdquo; We do not pretend to know to what
      precise extent the canonists of Oxford agree with those of Rome as to the
      circumstances which nullify orders. We will not, therefore, go so far as
      Chillingworth. We only say that we see no satisfactory proof of the fact,
      that the Church of England possesses the apostolical succession. And,
      after all, if Mr. Gladstone could prove the apostolical succession, what
      would the apostolical succession prove? He says that &ldquo;we have among us the
      ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, conveying it to us through an
      <i>unbroken</i> series from our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles.&rdquo; Is
      this the fact? Is there any doubt that the orders of the Church of England
      are generally derived from the Church of Rome? Does not the Church of
      England declare, does not Mr. Gladstone himself admit, that the Church of
      Rome teaches much error and condemns much truth? And is it not quite
      clear, that as far as the doctrines of the Church of England differ from
      those of the Church of Rome, so far the Church of England conveys the
      truth through a broken series? <span class="pagenum">174</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>That the founders, lay and clerical, of
      the Church of England, corrected all that required correction in the
      doctrines of the Church of Rome, and nothing more, may be quite true. But
      we never can admit the circumstance that the Church of England possesses
      the apostolical succession as a proof that she is thus perfect. No stream
      can rise higher than its fountain. The succussion of ministers in the
      Church of England, derived as it is through the Church of Rome, can never
      prove more for the Church of England than it proves for the Church of
      Rome. But this is not all. The Arian Churches which once predominated in
      the kingdoms of the Ostrogoths, the Visigoths, the Burgundians, the
      Vandals, and the Lombards, were all episcopal churches, and all had a
      fairer claim than that of England to the apostolical succession, as being
      much nearer to the apostolical times. In the East, the Greek Church, which
      is at variance on points of faith with all the Western Churches, has an
      equal claim to this succession. The Nestorian, the Eutychian, the Jacobite
      Churches, all heretical, all condemned by councils, of which even
      Protestant divines have generally spoken with respect, had an equal claim
      to the apostolical succession. Now if, of teachers having apostolical
      orders, a vast majority have taught much error, if a large proportion have
      taught deadly heresy, if, on the other hand, as Mr. Gladstone himself
      admits, churches not having apostolical orders, that of Scotland for
      example, have been nearer to the standard of orthodoxy than the majority
      of teachers who have had apostolical orders, how can he possibly call upon
      us to submit our private judgment to the authority of a Church on the
      ground that she has these orders?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone dwells much on the importance of unity <span class="pagenum">175</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a>in doctrine. Unity, he tells us, is
      essential to truth. And this is most unquestionable. But when he goes on
      to tell us that this unity is the characteristic of the Church of England,
      that she is one in body and in spirit, we are compelled to differ from him
      widely. The apostolical succession she may or may not have. But unity she
      most certainly has not, and never has had. It is matter of perfect
      notoriety-, that her formularies are framed in such a manner as to admit
      to her highest offices men who differ from each other more widely than a
      very high Churchman differs from a Catholic, or a very low Churchman from
      a Presbyterian; and that the general leaning of the Church, with respect
      to some important questions, has been sometimes one way and sometimes
      another. Take, for example, the questions agitated between the Calvinists
      and the Arminians. Do we find in the Church of England, with respect to
      those questions, that unity which is essential to truth? Was it ever found
      in the Church? Is it not certain that, at the end of the sixteenth
      century, the rulers of the Church held doctrines as Calvinistic as ever
      were held by any Cameronian, and not only held them, but persecuted
      everybody who did not hold them? And is it not equally certain, that the
      rulers of the Church have, in very recent times, considered Calvinism as a
      disqualification for high preferment, if not for holy orders? Look at the
      questions which Archbishop Whitgift propounded to Barret, questions framed
      in the very spirit of William Huntington, S. S. (1) And then look at the
      eighty-seven questions which Bishop
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) One question was, whether God had from eternity
     reprobated certain persons; and why? The answer which
     contented the Archbishop was &ldquo;Affirmative, et quia voluit.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">176</span><a name="link176" id="link176"></a>Marsh,
      within our own memory, propounded to candidates for ordination. We should
      be loth to say that either of these celebrated prelates had intruded
      himself into a Church whose doctrines he abhorred, and that he deserved to
      be stripped of his gown. Yet it is quite certain that one or other of them
      must have been very greatly in error. John Wesley again, and Cowper&rsquo;s
      friend, John Newton, were both Presbyters of this Church. Both were men of
      ability. Both we believe to have been men of rigid integrity, men who
      would not have subscribed a Confession of Faith which they disbelieved for
      the richest bishopric in the empire. Yet, on the subject of
      predestination, Newton was strongly attached to doctrines which Wesley
      designated as &ldquo;blasphemy, which might make the ears of a Christian to
      tingle.&rdquo; Indeed, it will not be disputed that the clergy of the
      Established Church are divided as to these questions, and that her
      formularies are not found practically to exclude even scrupulously honest
      men of both sides from her altars. It is notorious that some of her most
      distinguished rulers think this latitude a good thing, and would be sorry
      to see it restricted in favour of either opinion. And herein we most
      cordially agree with them. But what becomes of the unity of the Church,
      and of that truth to which unity is essential? Mr. Gladstone tells us that
      the <i>Règium Donum</i> was given originally to orthodox Presbyterian
      ministers, but that part of it is now received by their heterodox
      successors. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;serves to illustrate the difficulty in which
      governments entangle themselves, when they covenant with arbitrary systems
      of opinion, and not with the Church alone. The opinion passes away, but
      the gift remains.&rdquo; But is it not clear, that if a strong Supralapsarian
      had, under <span class="pagenum">177</span><a name="link177" id="link177"></a>Whitgift&rsquo;s
      primacy, left a large estate at the disposal of the bishops for
      ecclesiastical purposes, in the hope that the rulers of the Church would
      abide by Whitgift&rsquo;s theology, he would really have been giving his
      substance for the support of doctrines which he detested? The opinion
      would have passed away, and the gift would have remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is only a single instance. What wide differences of opinion
      respecting the operation of the sacraments are held by bishops, doctors,
      presbyters of the Church of England, all men who have conscientiously
      declared their assent to her articles, all men who are, according to Mr.
      Gladstone, ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, all men whose
      voices make up what, he tells us, is the voice of true and reasonable
      authority! Here, again, the Church has not unity; and as unity is the
      essential condition of truth, the Church has not the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, take the very question which we are discussing with Mr. Gladstone. To
      what extent does the Church of England allow of the right of private
      judgment? What degree of authority does she claim for herself in virtue of
      the apostolical succession of her ministers? Mr. Gladstone, a very able
      and a very honest man, takes a view of this matter widely differing from
      the view taken by others whom he will admit to be as able and as honest as
      himself. People who altogether dissent from him on this subject eat the
      bread of the Church, preach in her pulpits, dispense her sacraments,
      confer her orders, and carry on that apostolical succession, the nature
      and importance of which, according to him, they do not comprehend. Is this
      unity? Is this truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be observed that we are not putting cases of <span class="pagenum">178</span><a
      name="link178" id="link178"></a>dishonest men who, for the sake of lucre,
      falsely pretend to believe in the doctrines of an establishment. We are
      putting cases of men as upright as ever lived, who, differing on
      theological questions of the highest importance, and avowing that
      difference, are yet priests and prelates of the same Church. We therefore
      say, that on some points which Mr. Gladstone himself thinks of vital
      importance, the Church has either not spoken at all, or, what is for all
      practical purposes the same thing, has not spoken in language to be
      understood even by honest and sagacious divines. The religion of the
      Church of England is so far from exhibiting that unity of doctrine which
      Mr. Gladstone represents as her distinguishing glory, that it is, in fact,
      a bundle of religious systems without number. It comprises the religious
      system of Bishop Tomline, and the religious system of John Newton, and all
      the religious systems which lie between them. It comprises the religious
      system of Mr. Newman, and the religious system of the Archbishop of
      Dublin, and all the religious systems which lie between them. All these
      different opinions are held, avowed, preached, printed, within the pale of
      the Church, by men of unquestioned integrity and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we make this diversity a topic of reproach to the Church of England?
      Far from it. We would oppose with all our power every attempt to narrow
      her basis! Would to God that, a hundred and fifty years ago, a good king
      and a good primate had possessed the power as well as the will to widen
      it! It was a noble enterprise, worthy of William and of Tillotson. But
      what becomes of all Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s eloquent exhortations to unity? Is it
      not mere mockery to attach so much importance to unity in form and name,
      where there is <span class="pagenum">179</span><a name="link179"
       id="link179"></a>so little in substance, to shudder at the thought of two
      churches in alliance with one state, and to endure with patience the
      spectacle of a hundred sects battling within one church? And is it not
      clear that Mr. Gladstone is bound, on all his own principles, to abandon
      the defence of a church in which unity is not found? Is it not clear that
      he is bound to divide the House of Commons against every grant of money
      which may be proposed for the clergy of the Established Church in the
      colonies? He objects to the vote for Maynooth, because it is monstrous to
      pay one man to teach truth, and another to denounce that truth as
      falsehood. But it is a mere chance whether any sum which he votes for the
      English Church in any colony will go to the maintenance of an Arminian or
      a Calvinist, of a man like Mr. Froude, or of a man like Dr. Arnold. It is
      a mere chance, therefore, whether it will go to support a teacher of
      truth, or one who will denounce that truth as falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This argument seems to us at once to dispose of all that part of Mr.
      Gladstone&rsquo;s book which respects grants of public money to dissenting
      bodies. All such grants he condemns. But surely, if it be wrong to give
      the money of the public for the support of those who teach false doctrine,
      it is wrong to give that money for the support of the ministers of the
      Established Church. For it is quite certain that, whether Calvin or
      Arminius be in the right, whether Laud or Burnet be in the right, a great
      deal of false doctrine is taught by the ministers of the Established
      Church. If it be said that the points on which the clergy of the Church of
      England differ ought to be passed over, for the sake of the many important
      points on which they agree, why may not the same argument be maintained
      with respect to other <span class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180"
       id="link180"></a>sects which hold in common with the Church of England the
      fundamental doctrines of Christianity? The principle that a ruler is bound
      in conscience to propagate religious truth, and to propagate no religious
      doctrine which is untrue, is abandoned as soon as it is admitted that a
      gentleman of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s opinions may lawfully vote the public money
      to a chaplain whose opinions are those of Paley or Simeon. The whole
      question then becomes one of degree. Of course no individual and no
      government can justifiably propagate error for the sake of propagating
      error. But both individuals and governments must work with such machinery
      as they have; and no human machinery is to be found which will impart
      truth without some alloy of error. We have shown irrefragably, as we
      think, that the Church of England does not afford such a machinery. The
      question then is this; with what degree of imperfection in our machinery
      must we put up? And to this question we do not see how any general answer
      can be given. We must be guided by circumstances. It would, for example,
      be very criminal in a Protestant to contribute to the sending of Jesuit
      missionaries among a Protestant population. But we do not conceive that a
      Protestant would be to blame for giving assistance to Jesuit missionaries
      who might be engaged in converting the Siamese to Christianity. That tares
      are mixed with the wheat is matter of regret; but it is better that wheat
      and tares should grow together than that the promise of the year should be
      blighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone, we see, with deep regret, censures the British government
      in India for distributing a small sum among the Catholic priests who
      minister to the spiritual wants of our Irish soldiers. Now, let us put a
      <span class="pagenum">181</span><a name="link181" id="link181"></a>case to
      him. A Protestant gentleman is attended by a Catholic servant, in a part
      of the country where there is no Catholic congregation within many miles.
      The servant is taken ill, and is given over. He desires, in great trouble
      of mind, to receive the last sacraments of his Church. His master sends
      off a messenger in a chaise and four, with orders to bring a confessor
      from a town at a considerable distance. Here a Protestant lays out money
      for the purpose of causing religious instruction and consolation to be
      given by a Catholic priest. Has he committed a sin? Has he not acted like
      a good master and a good Christian? Would Mr. Gladstone accuse him of
      &ldquo;laxity of religious principle,&rdquo; of &ldquo;confounding truth with falsehood,&rdquo; of
      &ldquo;considering the support of religion as a boon to an individual, not as a
      homage to truth?&rdquo; But how if this servant had, for the sake of his master,
      undertaken a journey which removed him from the place where he might
      easily have obtained religious attendance? How if his death were
      occasioned by a wound received in defending his master? Should we not then
      say that the master had only fulfilled a sacred obligation of duty? Now,
      Mr. Gladstone himself owns that &ldquo;nobody can think that the personality of
      the state is more stringent, or entails stronger obligations, than that of
      the individual.&rdquo; How then stands the case of the Indian government? Here
      is a poor fellow, enlisted in Clare or Kerry, sent over fifteen thousand
      miles of sea, quartered in a depressing and pestilential climate. He
      fights for the government; he conquers for it; he is wounded; he is laid
      on his pallet, withering away with fever, under that terrible sun, without
      a friend near him. He pines for the consolations of that religion which,
      neglected perhaps in the season of health and vigour, <span class="pagenum">182</span><a
      name="link182" id="link182"></a>now comes back to his mind, associated
      with all the overpowering recollections of his earlier days, and of the
      home which he is never to see again. And because the state for which he
      dies sends a priest of his own faith to stand at his bedside, and to tell
      him, in language which at once commands his love and confidence, of the
      common Father, of the common Redeemer, of the common hope of immortality,
      because the state for which he dies does not abandon him in his last
      moments to the care of heathen attendants, or employ a chaplain of a
      different creed to vex his departing spirit with a controversy about the
      Council of Trent, Mr. Gladstone finds that India presents &ldquo;a melancholy
      picture,&rdquo; and that there is &ldquo;a large allowance of false principle&rdquo; in the
      system pursued there. Most earnestly do we hope that our remarks may
      induce Mr. Gladstone to reconsider this part of his work, and may prevent
      him from expressing in that high assembly, in which he must always be
      heard with attention, opinions so unworthy of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now said almost all that we think it necessary to say respecting
      Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s theory. And perhaps it would be safest for us to stop
      here. It is much easier to pull down than to build up. Yet, that we may
      give Mr. Gladstone his revenge, we will state precisely our own views
      respecting the alliance of Church and State.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set out in company with Warburton, and remain with him pretty sociably
      till we come to his contract; a contract which Mr. Gladstone very properly
      designates as a fiction. We consider the primary end of government as a
      purely temporal end, the protection of the persons and property of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think that government, like every other contrivance <span
      class="pagenum">183</span><a name="link183" id="link183"></a>of human
      wisdom, from the highest to the lowest, is likely to answer its main end
      best when it is constructed with a single view to that end. Mr. Gladstone,
      who loves Plato, will not quarrel with us for illustrating our
      proposition, after Plato&rsquo;s fashion, from the most familiar objects. Take
      cutlery, for example A blade which is designed both to shave and to carve,
      will certainly not shave so well as a razor, or carve so well as a
      carving-knife. An academy of painting, which should also be a bank, would,
      in all probability, exhibit very bad pictures and discount very bad bills.
      A gas company, which should also be an infant school society, would, we
      apprehend, light the streets ill, and teach the children ill. On this
      principle, we think that government should be organized solely with a view
      to its main end; and that no part of its efficiency for that end should be
      sacrificed, in order to promote any other end however excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But does it follow from thence that governments ought never to pursue any
      end, other than their main end? In no wise. Though it is desirable that
      every institution should have a main end, and should be so formed as to be
      in the highest degree efficient for that main end; yet if, without any
      sacrifice of its efficiency for that end, it can pursue any other good
      end, it ought to do so. Thus, the end for which a hospital is built is the
      relief of the sick, not the beautifying of the street. To sacrifice the
      health of the sick to splendour of architectural effect, to place the
      building in a bad air only that it may present a more commanding front to
      a great public place, to make the wards hotter or cooler than they ought
      to be, in order that the columns and windows of the exterior may please
      the passers-by, would be monstrous. But if, without any sacrifice of <span
      class="pagenum">184</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>the chief
      object, the hospital can be made an ornament to the metropolis, it would
      be absurd not to make it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same manner, if a government can, without any sacrifice of its main
      end, promote any other good work, it ought to do so. The encouragement of
      the fine arts, for example, is by no means the main end of government; and
      it would be absurd, in constituting a government, to bestow a thought on
      the question, whether it would be a government likely to train Raphaels
      and Domenichinos. But it by no means follows that it is improper for a
      government to form a national gallery of pictures. The same may be said of
      patronage bestowed on learned men, of the publication of archives, of the
      collecting of libraries, menageries, plants, fossils, antiques, of
      journeys and voyages for purposes of geographical discovery or
      astronomical observation. It is not for these ends that government is
      constituted. But it may well happen that a government may have at its
      command resources which will enable it, without any injury to its main
      end, to pursue these collateral ends far more effectually than any
      individual or any voluntary association could do. If so, government ought
      to pursue these collateral ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still more evidently the duty of government to promote, always in
      subordination to its main end, every thing which is useful as a means for
      the attaining of that main end. The improvement of steam navigation, for
      example, is by no means a primary object of government. But as steam
      vessels are useful for the purpose of national defence, and for the
      purpose of facilitating intercourse between distant provinces, and of
      thereby consolidating the force of the empire, it may be the bounden duty
      of government to encourage <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a>ingenious men to perfect an invention
      which so directly tends to make the state more efficient for its great
      primary end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on both these grounds, the instruction of the people may with
      propriety engage the care of the government. That the people should be
      well educated, is in itself a good thing: and the state ought therefore to
      promote this object, if it can do so without any sacrifice of its primary
      object. The education of the people, conducted on those principles of
      morality which are common to all the forms of Christianity, is highly
      valuable as a means of promoting the main object for which government
      exists, and is on this ground well deserving the attention of rulers. We
      will not at present go into the general question of education; but will
      confine our remarks to the subject which is more immediately before us,
      namely, the religious instruction of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may illustrate our view of the policy which governments ought to pursue
      with respect to religious instruction, by recurring to the analogy of a
      hospital. Religious instruction is not the main end for which a hospital
      is built; and to introduce into a hospital any regulations prejudicial to
      the health of the patients, on the plea of promoting their spiritual
      improvement, to send a ranting preacher to a man who has just been ordered
      by the physician to be quiet and try to get a little sleep, to impose a
      strict observance of Lent on a convalescent who has been advised to eat
      heartily of nourishing food, to direct, as the bigoted Pius the Fifth
      actually did, that no medical assistance should be given to any person who
      declined spiritual attendance, would be the most extravagant folly. Yet it
      by no means follows that it would not be right to have a <span
      class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186" id="link186"></a>chaplain to
      attend the sick, and to pay such a chaplain out of the hospital funds.
      Whether it will be proper to have such a chaplain at all, and of what
      religious persuasion such a chaplain ought to be, must depend on
      circumstances. There may be a town in which it would be impossible to set
      up a good hospital without the help of people of different opinions: and
      religious parties may run so high that, though people of different
      opinions are willing to contribute for the relief of the sick, they will
      not concur in the choice of any one chaplain. The high Churchmen insist
      that, if there is a paid chaplain, he shall be a high Churchman. The
      Evangelicals stickle for an Evangelical. Here it would evidently be absurd
      and cruel to let an useful and humane design, about which all are agreed,
      fall to the ground, because all cannot agree about something else. The
      governors must either appoint two chaplains, and pay them both; or they
      must appoint none; and every one of them must, in his individual capacity,
      do what he can for the purpose of providing the sick with such religious
      instruction and consolation as will, in his opinion, be most useful to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should say the same of government. Government is not an institution for
      the propagation of religion, any more than St. George&rsquo;s Hospital is an
      institution for the propagation of religion: and the most absurd and
      pernicious consequences would follow, if Government should pursue, as its
      primary end, that which can never be more than its secondary end, though
      intrinsically more important than its primary end. But a government which
      considers the religious instruction of the people as a secondary end, and
      follows out that principle faithfully, will, we think, be likely to do
      much good and little harm. <span class="pagenum">187</span><a
      name="link187" id="link187"></a>We will rapidly run over some of the
      consequences to which this principle leads, and point out how it solves
      some problems which, on Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s hypothesis, admit of no
      satisfactory solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      All persecution directed against the persons or property of men is, on our
      principle, obviously indefensible. For, the protection of the persons and
      property of men being the primary end of government, and religious
      instruction only a secondary end, to secure the people from heresy by
      making their lives, their limbs, or their estates insecure, would be to
      sacrifice the primary end to the secondary end. It would be as absurd as
      it would be in the governors of a hospital to direct that the wounds of
      all Allan and Socinian patients should be dressed in such a way as to make
      them fester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, on our principles, all civil disabilities on account of religious
      opinions are indefensible. For all such disabilities make government less
      efficient for its main end: they limit its choice of able men for the
      administration and defence of the state; they alienate from it the hearts
      of the sufferers; they deprive it of a part of its effective strength in
      all contests with foreign nations. Such a course is as absurd as it would
      be in the governors of a hospital to reject an able surgeon because he is
      an Universal Restitutionist, and to send a bungler to operate because he
      is perfectly orthodox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, on our principles, no government ought to press on the people
      religious instruction, however sound, in such a manner as to excite among
      them discontents dangerous to public order. For here again government
      would sacrifice its primary end to an end intrinsically indeed of the
      highest importance, but still <span class="pagenum">188</span><a
      name="link188" id="link188"></a>only a secondary end of government, as
      government. This rule at once disposes of the difficulty about India, a
      difficulty of which Mr. Gladstone can get rid only by putting in an
      imaginary discharge in order to set aside an imaginary obligation. There
      is assuredly no country where it is more desirable that Christianity
      should be propagated. But there is no country in which the government is
      so completely disqualified for the task. By using our power in order to
      make proselytes, we should produce the dissolution of society, and bring
      utter ruin on all those interests for the protection of which government
      exists. Here the secondary end is, at present, inconsistent with the
      primary end, and must therefore be abandoned. Christian instruction given
      by individuals and voluntary societies may do much good. Given by the
      government it would do unmixed harm. At the same time, we quite agree with
      Mr. Gladstone in thinking that the English authorities in India ought not
      to participate in any idolatrous rite; and indeed we are fully satisfied
      that all such participation is not only unchristian, but also unwise and
      most undignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing the circumstances of a country to be such, that the government
      may with propriety, on our principles, give religious instruction to a
      people; we have next to inquire, what religion shall be taught. Bishop
      Warburton answers, the religion of the majority. And we so far agree with
      him, that we can scarcely conceive any circumstances in which it would be
      proper to establish, as the one exclusive religion of the state, the
      religion of the minority. Such a preference could hardly be given without
      exciting most serious discontent, and endangering those interests, the
      protection of which is the first object of government. <span
      class="pagenum">189</span><a name="link189" id="link189"></a>But we never
      can admit that a ruler can be justified in helping to spread a system of
      opinions solely because that system is pleasing to the majority. On the
      other hand, we cannot agree with Mr. Gladstone, who would of course answer
      that the only religion which a ruler ought to propagate is the religion of
      his own conscience. In truth, this is an impossibility. And as we have
      shown, Mr. Gladstone himself, whenever he supports a grant of money to the
      Church of England, is really assisting to propagate, not the precise
      religion of his own conscience, but some one or more, he knows not how
      many or which, of the innumerable religions which lie between the confines
      of Pelagianism and those of Antinomianism, and between the confines of
      Popery and those of Presbyterianism. In our opinion, that religious
      instruction which the ruler ought, in his public capacity, to patronise,
      is the instruction from which he, in his conscience, believes that the
      people will learn most good with the smallest mixture of evil. And thus it
      is not necessarily his own religion that he will select. He will, of
      course, believe that his own religion is unmixedly good. But the question
      which he has to consider is, not how much good his religion contains, but
      how much good the people will learn, if instruction is given them in that
      religion. He may prefer the doctrines and government of the Church of
      England to those of the Church of Scotland. But if he knows that a Scotch
      congregation will listen with deep attention and respect while an Erskine
      or a Chalmers sets before them the fundamental doctrines of Christianity,
      and that a glimpse of a surplice or a single line of a liturgy would be
      the signal for hooting and riot, and would probably bring stools and
      brick-bats about the ears of the minister, he acts wisely if he conveys
      religious <span class="pagenum">190</span><a name="link190" id="link190"></a>knowledge
      to the Scotch rather by means of that imperfect Church, as he may think
      it, from which they will learn much, than by means of that perfect Church
      from which they will learn nothing. The only end of teaching is, that men
      may learn; and it is idle to talk of the duty of teaching truth in ways
      which only cause men to cling more firmly to falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these principles we conceive that a statesman, who might be far indeed
      from regarding the Church of England with the reverence which Mr.
      Gladstone feels for her, might yet firmly oppose all attempts to destroy
      her. Such a statesman may be too well acquainted with her origin to look
      upon her with superstitious awe. He may know that she sprang from a
      compromise huddled up between the eager zeal of reformers and the
      selfishness of greedy, ambitious, and time-serving politicians. He may
      find in every page of her annals ample cause for censure. He may feel that
      he could not, with ease to his conscience, subscribe all her articles. He
      may regret that all the attempts which have been made to open her gates to
      large classes of non-comformists should have failed. Her episcopal polity
      he may consider as of purely human institution. He cannot defend her on
      the ground that she possesses the apostolical succession; for he does not
      know whether that succession may not be altogether a fable. He cannot
      defend her on the ground of her unity; for he knows that her frontier
      sects are much more remote from each other, than one frontier is from the
      Church of Rome, or the other from the Church of Geneva. But he may think
      that she teaches more truth with less alloy of error than would be taught
      by those who, if she were swept away, would occupy the vacant space. He
      may think that the effect produced by her beautiful services and by her
      <span class="pagenum">191</span><a name="link191" id="link191"></a>pulpits
      on the national mind, is, on the whole, highly beneficial. He may think
      that her civilising influence is usefully felt in remote districts. He may
      think that, if she were destroyed, a large portion of those who now
      compose her congregations would neglect all religious duties, and that a
      still larger portion would fall under the influence of spiritual
      mountebanks, hungry for gain, or drunk with fanaticism. While he would
      with pleasure admit that all the qualities of Christian pastors are to be
      found in large measure within the existing body of Dissenting ministers,
      he would perhaps be inclined to think that the standard of intellectual
      and moral character among that exemplary class of men may have been raised
      to its present high point and maintained there by the indirect influence
      of the Establishment. And he may be by no means satisfied that, if the
      Church were at once swept away, the place of our Sumners and Whateleys
      would be supplied by Doddridges and Halls. He may think that the
      advantages which we have described are obtained, or might, if the existing
      system were slightly modified, be obtained, without any sacrifice of the
      paramount objects which all governments ought to have chiefly in view.
      Nay, he may be of opinion that an institution, so deeply fixed in the
      hearts and minds of millions, could not be subverted without loosening and
      shaking all the foundations of civil society. With at least equal ease he
      would find reasons for supporting the Church of Scotland. Nor would he be
      under the necessity of resorting to any contract to justify the connection
      of two religious establishments with one government. He would think
      scruples on that head frivolous in any person who is zealous for a Church,
      of which both Dr. Herbert Marsh and Dr. Daniel Wilson have been bishops.
      Indeed he <span class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a>would
      gladly follow out his principles much further. He would have been willing
      to vote in 1825 for Lord Francis Egerton&rsquo;s resolution, that it is
      expedient to give a public maintenance to the Catholic clergy of Ireland:
      and he would deeply regret that no such measure was adopted in 1829.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, we conceive, a statesman might on our principles satisfy
      himself that it would be in the highest degree inexpedient to abolish the
      Church, either of England or of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if there were, in any part of the world, a national church regarded as
      heretical by four-fifths of the nation committed to its care, a church
      established and maintained by the sword, a church producing twice as many
      riots as conversions, a church which, though possessing great wealth and
      power, and though long backed by persecuting laws, had, in the course of
      many generations, been found unable to propagate its doctrines, and barely
      able to maintain its ground, a church so odious, that fraud and violence,
      when used against its clear rights of property, were generally regarded as
      fair play, a church, whose ministers were preaching to desolate walls, and
      with difficulty obtaining their lawful subsistence by the help of
      bayonets, such a church, on our principles, could not, we must own, be
      defended. We should say that the state which allied itself with such a
      church postponed the primary end of government to the secondary: and that
      the consequences had been such as any sagacious observer would have
      predicted. Neither the primary nor the secondary end is attained. The
      temporal and spiritual interests of the people suffer alike. The minds of
      men, instead of being drawn to the church, are alienated from the state.
      The magistrate, after sacrificing order, <span class="pagenum">193</span><a
      name="link193" id="link193"></a>peace, union, all the interests which it
      is his first duty to protect, for the purpose of promoting pure religion,
      is forced, after the experience of centuries, to admit that he has really
      been promoting error. The sounder the doctrines of such a church, the more
      absurd and noxious the superstition by which those doctrines are opposed,
      the stronger are the arguments against the policy which has deprived a
      good cause of its natural advantages. Those who preach to rulers the duty
      of employing power to propagate truth would do well to remember that
      falsehood, though no match for truth alone, has often been found more than
      a match for truth and power together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A statesman, judging on our principles, would pronounce without hesitation
      that a church, such as we have last described, never ought to have been
      set up. Further than this we will not venture to speak for him. He would
      doubtless remember that the world is full of institutions which, though
      they never ought to have been set up, yet, having been set up, ought not
      to be rudely pulled down; and that it is often wise in practice to be
      content with the mitigation of an abuse which, looking at it in the
      abstract, we might feel impatient to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have done; and nothing remains but that we part from Mr. Gladstone with
      the courtesy of antagonists who bear no malice. We dissent from his
      opinions, but we admire his talents; we respect his integrity and
      benevolence; and we hope that he will not suffer political avocations so
      entirely to engross him, as to leave him no leisure for literature and
      philosophy.

      LORD CLIVE. (1)

    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, January, 1840.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">194</span><a name="link194" id="link194"></a>have always
      thought it strange that, while the history of the Spanish empire in
      America is familiarly known to all the nations of Europe, the great
      actions of our countrymen in the East should, even among ourselves, excite
      little interest. Every schoolboy knows who imprisoned Montezuma, and who
      strangled Atahualpa. But we doubt whether one in ten, even among English
      gentlemen of highly cultivated minds, can tell who won the battle of
      Buxar, who perpetrated the massacre of Patna, whether Sujah Dowlah ruled
      in Oude or in Travancore, or whether Holkar was a Hindoo or a Mussulman.
      Yet the victories of Cortes were gained over savages who had no letters,
      who were ignorant of the use of metals, who had not broken in a single
      animal to labour, who wielded no better weapons than those which could be
      made out of sticks, flints, and fish-bones, who regarded a horse-soldier
      as a monster, half man and half beast, who took a harquebusier for a
      sorcerer, able to scatter the thunder and lightning of the skies. The
      people of India, when we subdued them, were ten times as numerous as the
      Americans whom the Spaniards vanquished,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>The Life of Robert Lord Clive; collected from the
     Family Papers, communicated by the Earl of Powis</i>. By Major-
     General Sir John Malcolm, K. C. B. 3 vols. 8vo. London:
     1836.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">195</span><a name="link195" id="link195"></a>and
      were at the same time quite as highly civilised as the victorious
      Spaniards. They had reared cities larger and fairer than Saragossa or
      Toledo, and buildings more beautiful and costly than the cathedral of
      Seville. They could show bankers richer than the richest firms of
      Barcelona or Cadiz, viceroys whose splendour far surpassed that of
      Ferdinand the Catholic, myriads of cavalry and long trains of artillery
      which would have astonished the Great Captain. It might have been
      expected, that every Englishman who takes, any interest in any part of
      history would be curious to know how a handful of his countrymen,
      separated from their home by an immense ocean, subjugated, in the course
      of a few years, one of the greatest empires in the world. Yet, unless we
      greatly err, this subject is, to most readers, not only insipid, but
      positively distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the fault lies partly with the historians. Mr. Mill&rsquo;s book, though
      it has undoubtedly great and rare merit, is not sufficiently animated and
      picturesque to attract those who read for amusement. Orme, inferior to no
      English historian in style and power of painting, is minute even to
      tediousness. In one volume he allots, on an average, a closely printed
      quarto page to the events of every forty-eight hours. The consequence is,
      that his narrative, though one of the most authentic and one of the most
      finely written in our language, has never been very popular, and is now
      scarcely ever read.
    </p>
    <p>
      We fear that the volumes before us will not much attract those readers
      whom Orme and Mill have repelled. The materials placed at the disposal of
      Sir John Malcolm by the late Lord Powis were indeed of great value. But we
      cannot say that they have been very <span class="pagenum">196</span><a
      name="link196" id="link196"></a>skilfully worked up. It would, however, be
      unjust to criticise with severity a work which, if the author had lived to
      complete and revise it, would probably have been improved by condensation
      and by a better arrangement. We are the more disposed to perform the
      pleasing duty of expressing our gratitude to the noble family to which the
      public owes so much useful and curious information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the book, even when we make the largest allowance for the
      partiality of those who have furnished and of those who have digested the
      materials, is, on the whole, greatly to raise the character of Lord Clive.
      We are far indeed from sympathizing with Sir John Malcolm, whose love
      passes the love of biographers, and who can see nothing but wisdom and
      justice in the actions of his idol. But we are at least equally far from
      concurring in the severe judgment of Mr. Mill, who seems to us to show
      less discrimination in his account of Clive than in any other part of his
      valuable work. Clive, like most men who are born with strong passions and
      tried by strong temptations, committed great faults. But every person who
      takes a fair and enlightened view of his whole career must admit that our
      island, so fertile in heroes and statesmen, has scarcely ever produced a
      man more truly great either in arms or in council.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Clives had been settled, ever since the twelfth century, on an estate
      of no great value, near Market-Drayton, in Shropshire. In the reign of
      George the First this moderate but ancient inheritance was possessed by
      Mr. Richard Clive, who seems to have been a plain man of no great tact or
      capacity. He had been bred to the law, and divided his time between
      professional business and the avocations of a small proprietor. <span
      class="pagenum">197</span><a name="link197" id="link197"></a>He married a
      lady from Manchester, of the name of Gaskill, and became the father of a
      very numerous family. His eldest son, Robert, the founder of the British
      empire in India, was born at the old seat of his ancestors on the
      twenty-ninth of September, 1725.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some lineaments of the character of the man were early discerned in the
      child. There remain letters written by his relations when he was in his
      seventh year; and from these letters it appears that, even at that early
      age, his strong will and his fiery passions, sustained by a constitutional
      intrepidity which sometimes seemed hardly compatible with soundness of
      mind, had begun to cause great uneasiness to his family. &ldquo;Fighting,&rdquo; says
      one of his uncles, &ldquo;to which he is out of measure addicted, gives his
      temper such a fierceness and imperiousness, that he flies out on every
      trifling occasion.&rdquo; The old people of the neighbourhood still remember to
      have heard from their parents how Bob Clive climbed to the top of the
      lofty steeple of Market-Drayton, and with what terror the inhabitants saw
      him seated on a stone spout near the summit. They also relate how he
      formed all the idle lads of the town into a kind of predatory army, and
      compelled the shopkeepers to submit to a tribute of apples and halfpence,
      in consideration of which he guaranteed the security of their windows. He
      was sent from school to school, making very little progress in his
      learning, and gaining for himself everywhere the character of an
      exceedingly naughty boy. One of his masters, it is said, was sagacious
      enough to prophesy that the idle lad would make a great figure in the
      world. But the general opinion seems to have been that poor Robert was a
      dunce, if not a reprobate. His family expected nothing good from such
      slender parts <span class="pagenum">198</span><a name="link198"
       id="link198"></a>and such a headstrong temper. It is not strange,
      therefore, that they gladly accepted for him, when he was in his
      eighteenth year, a writership in the service of the East India Company,
      and shipped him off to make a fortune or to die of a fever at Madras.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far different were the prospects of Clive from those of the youths whom
      the East India College now annually sends to the Presidencies of our
      Asiatic empire. The Company was then purely a trading corporation. Its
      territory consisted of a few square miles, for which rent was paid to the
      native governments. Its troops were scarcely numerous enough to man the
      batteries of three or four ill-constructed forts, which had been erected
      for the protection of the warehouses. The natives, who composed a
      considerable part of these little garrisons, had not yet been trained in
      the discipline of Europe, and were armed, some with swords and shields,
      some with bows and arrows. The business of the servant of the Company was
      not, as now, to conduct the judicial, financial, and diplomatic business
      of a great country, but to take stock, to make advances to weavers, to
      ship cargoes, and above all, to keep an eye on private traders who dared
      to infringe the monopoly. The younger clerks were so miserably paid that
      they could scarcely subsist without incurring debt; the elder enriched
      themselves by trading on their own account; and those who lived to rise to
      the top of the service often accumulated considerable fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madras, to which Clive had been appointed, was, at this time, perhaps, the
      first in importance of the Company&rsquo;s settlements. In the preceding century
      Fort St. George had risen on a barren spot beaten by a raging surf; and in
      the neighbourhood a town, inhabited by many thousands of natives, had
      sprung up, as towns <span class="pagenum">199</span><a name="link199"
       id="link199"></a>spring up in the East, with the rapidity of the prophet&rsquo;s
      gourd. There were already in the suburbs many white villas, each
      surrounded by its garden, whither the wealthy agents of the Company
      retired, after the labours of the desk and the warehouse, to enjoy the
      cool, breeze which springs up at sunset from the Bay of Bengal. The habits
      of these mercantile grandees appear to have been more profuse, luxurious,
      and ostentatious, than those of the high judicial and political
      functionaries who have succeeded them. But comfort was far less
      understood. Many devices which now mitigate the heat of the climate,
      preserve health, and prolong life, were unknown. There was far less
      intercourse with Europe than at present. The voyage by the Cape, which in
      our time has often been performed within three months, was then very
      seldom accomplished in six, and was sometimes protracted to more than a
      year. Consequently, the Anglo-Indian was then much more estranged from his
      country, much more addicted to Oriental usages, and much less fitted to
      mix in society after his return to Europe, than the Anglo-Indian of the
      present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the fort and its precinct, the English exercised, by permission of
      the native government, an extensive authority, such as every great Indian
      land-owner exercised within his own domain. But they had never dreamed of
      claiming independent power. The surrounding country was ruled by the Nabob
      of the Carnatic, a deputy of the Viceroy of the Deccan, commonly called
      the Nizam, who was himself only a deputy of the mighty prince designated
      by our ancestors as the Great Mogul. Those names, once so august and
      formidable, still remain. There is still a Nabob of the Carnatic, who
      lives on a pension allowed to him by the <span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200" id="link200"></a>English out of the revenues of the
      province which his ancestors ruled. There is still a Nizam, whose capital
      is overawed by a British cantonment, and to whom a British resident gives,
      under the name of advice, commands which are not to be disputed. There is
      still a Mogul, who is permitted to play at holding courts and receiving
      petitions, but who has less power to help or hurt than the youngest civil
      servant of the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive&rsquo;s voyage was unusually tedious even for that age. The ship remained
      some months at the Brazils, where the young adventurer picked up some
      knowledge of Portuguese, and spent all his pocket-money. He did not arrive
      in India till more than a year after he had left England. His situation at
      Madras was most painful. His funds were exhausted. His pay was small. He
      had contracted debts. He was wretchedly lodged, no small calamity in a
      climate which can be made tolerable to an European only by spacious and
      well placed apartments. He had been furnished with letters of
      recommendation to a gentleman who might have assisted him; but when he
      landed at. Fort St. George he found that this gentleman had sailed for
      England. The lad&rsquo;s shy and haughty disposition withheld him from
      introducing himself to strangers. He was several months in India before he
      became acquainted with a single family. The climate affected his health
      and spirits. His duties were of a kind ill suited to his ardent and daring
      character. He pined for his home, and in his letters to his relations
      expressed his feelings in language softer and more pensive than we should
      have expected either from the waywardness of his boyhood, or from the
      inflexible sternness of his later years. &ldquo;I have not enjoyed,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;one happy day since I left my native country;&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;I must
      confess, at intervals, <span class="pagenum">201</span><a name="link201"
       id="link201"></a>when I think of my dear native England, it affects me in
      a very particular manner.... If I should be so far blest as to revisit
      again my own country, but more especially Manchester, the centre of all my
      wishes, all that I could hope or desire for would be presented before me
      in one view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One solace he found of the most respectable kind. The Governor possessed a
      good library, and permitted Clive to have access to it. The young man
      devoted much of his leisure to reading, and acquired at this time almost
      all the knowledge of books that he ever possessed. As a boy he had been
      too idle, as a man he soon became too busy, for literary pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither climate nor poverty, neither study nor the sorrows of a
      home-sick exile, could tame the desperate audacity of his spirit. He
      behaved to his official superiors as he had behaved to his school-masters,
      and was several times in danger of losing his situation. Twice, while
      residing in the Writers&rsquo; Buildings, he attempted to destroy himself; and
      twice the pistol which he snapped at his own head failed to go off. This
      circumstance, it is said, affected him as a similar escape affected
      Wallenstein. After satisfying himself that the pistol was really well
      loaded, he burst forth into an exclamation that surely he was reserved for
      something great.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time an event which at first seemed likely to destroy all his
      hopes in life suddenly opened before him a new path to eminence. Europe
      had been, during some years, distracted by the war of the Austrian
      succession. George the Second was the steady ally of Maria Theresa. The
      house of Bourbon took the opposite side. Though England was even then the
      first of maritime powers, she was not, as she has since become, <span
      class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202" id="link202"></a>more than a
      match on the sea for all the nations of the world together; and she found
      it difficult to maintain a contest against the united navies of France and
      Spain. In the eastern seas France obtained the ascendency. Labourdonnais,
      governor of Mauritius, a man of eminent talents and virtues, conducted an
      expedition to the continent of India in spite of the opposition of the
      British fleet, landed, assembled an army, appeared before Madras, and
      compelled the town and fort to capitulate. The keys were delivered up; the
      French colours were displayed on Fort St. George; and the contents of the
      Company&rsquo;s warehouses were seized as prize of war by the conquerors. It was
      stipulated by the capitulation that the English inhabitants should be
      prisoners of war on parole, and that the town should remain in the hands
      of the French till it should be ransomed. Labourdonnais pledged his honour
      that only a moderate ransom should be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the success of Labourdonnais had awakened the jealousy of his
      countryman, Dupleix, governor of Pondicherry. Dupleix, moreover, had
      already begun to revolve gigantic schemes, with which the restoration of
      Madras to the English was by no means compatible. He declared that
      Labourdonnais had gone beyond his powers; that conquests made by the
      French arms on the continent of India were at the disposal of the governor
      of Pondicherry alone, and that Madras should be rased to the ground.
      Labourdonnais was compelled to yield. The anger which the breach of the
      capitulation excited among the English, was increased by the ungenerous
      manner in which Dupleix treated the principal servants of the Company. The
      Governor and several of the first gentlemen of Fort St. George were
      carried under a guard to Pondicherry, and conducted <span class="pagenum">203</span><a
      name="link203" id="link203"></a>through the town in a triumphal
      procession, under the eyes of fifty thousand spectators. It was with
      reason thought that this gross violation of public faith absolved the
      inhabitants of Madras from the engagements into which they had entered
      with Labourdonnais. Clive fled from the town by night in the disguise of a
      mussulman, and took refuge at Fort St. David, one of the small English
      settlements subordinate to Madras.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances in which he was now placed naturally led him to adopt a
      profession better suited to his restless and intrepid spirit than the
      business of examining packages and casting accounts. He solicited and
      obtained an ensign&rsquo;s commission in the service of the Company, and at
      twenty-one entered on his military career. His personal courage, of which
      he had, while still a writer, given signal proof by a desperate duel with
      a military bully, who was the terror of Fort St. David, speedily made him
      conspicuous even among hundreds of brave men. He soon began to show in his
      new calling other qualities which had not before been discerned in him,
      judgment, sagacity, deference to legitimate authority. He distinguished
      himself highly in several operations against the French, and was
      particularly noticed by Major Lawrence, who was then considered as the
      ablest British officer in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive had been only a few months in the army when intelligence arrived
      that peace had been concluded between Great Britain and France. Dupleix
      was in consequence compelled to restore Madras to the English Company; and
      the young ensign was at liberty to resume his former business. He did
      indeed return for a short time to his desk. He again quitted it in order
      to assist Major Lawrence in some petty hostilities with the natives, and
      then again returned to <span class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204"
       id="link204"></a>it. While he was thus wavering between a military and a
      commercial life, events took place which decided his choice. The politics
      of India assumed a new aspect. There was peace between the English and
      French Crowns; but there arose between the English and French Companies
      trading to the East a war most eventful and important, a war in which the
      prize was nothing less than the magnificent inheritance of the house of
      Tamerlane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The empire which Baber and his Moguls reared in the sixteenth century was
      long one of the most extensive and splendid in the world. In no European
      kingdom was so large a population subject to a single prince, or so large
      a revenue poured into the treasury. The beauty and magnificence of the
      buildings erected by the sovereigns of Hindostan amazed even travellers
      who had seen St. Peters. The innumerable retinues and gorgeous decorations
      which surrounded the throne of Delhi dazzled even eyes which were
      accustomed to the pomp of Versailles. Some of the great viceroys who held
      their posts by virtue of commissions from the Mogul ruled as many subjects
      as the King of France or the Emperor of Germany. Even the deputies of
      these deputies might well rank, as to extent of territory and amount of
      revenue, with the Grand Duke of Tuscany or the Elector of Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be little doubt that this great empire, powerful and prosperous
      as it appears on a superficial view, was yet, even in its best days, far
      worse governed than the worst governed parts of Europe now are. The
      administration was tainted with all the vices of Oriental despotism, and
      with all the vices inseparable from the domination of race over race. The
      conflicting pretensions of the princes of the royal house produced <span
      class="pagenum">205</span><a name="link205" id="link205"></a>a long series
      of crimes and public disasters. Ambitious lieutenants of the sovereign
      sometimes aspired to independence. Fierce tribes of Hindoos, impatient of
      a foreign yoke, frequently withheld tribute, repelled the armies of the
      government from the mountain fastnesses, and poured down in arms on the
      cultivated plains. In spite, however, of much constant maladministration,
      in spite of occasional convulsions which shook the whole frame of society,
      this great monarchy, on the whole, retained, during some generations, an
      outward appearance of unity, majesty, and energy. But, throughout the long
      reign of Aurungzebe, the state, notwithstanding all that the vigour and
      policy of the prince could effect, was hastening to dissolution. After his
      death, which took place in the year 1707, the ruin was fearfully rapid.
      Violent shocks from without co-operated with an incurable decay which was
      fast proceeding within; and in a few years the empire had undergone utter
      decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the successors of Theodosius bears no small analogy to that
      of the successors of Aurungzebe. But perhaps the fall of the Carlovingians
      furnishes the nearest parallel to the fall of the Moguls. Charlemagne was
      scarcely interred when the imbecility and the disputes of his descendants
      began to bring contempt on themselves and destruction on their subjects.
      The wide dominion of the Franks was severed into a thousand pieces.
      Nothing more than a nominal dignity was left to the abject heirs of an
      illustrious name, Charles the Bald, and Charles the Fat, and Charles the
      Simple. Fierce invaders, differing from each other in race, language, and
      religion, flocked, as if by concert, from the farthest comers of the
      earth, to plunder <span class="pagenum">206</span><a name="link206"
       id="link206"></a>provinces which the government could no longer defend.
      The pirates of the Northern Sea extended their ravages from the Elbe to
      the Pyrenees, and at length fixed their seat in the rich valley of the
      Seine. The Hungarian, in whom the trembling monks fancied that they
      recognized the Gog or Magog of prophecy, carried back the plunder of the
      cities of Lombardy to the depths of the Pannonian forests. The Saracen
      ruled in Sicily, desolated the fertile plains of Campania, and spread
      terror even to the walls of Rome. In the midst of these sufferings, a
      great internal change passed upon the empire. The corruption of death
      began to ferment into new forms of life. While the great body, as a whole,
      was torpid and passive, every separate member began to feel with a sense,
      and to move with an energy all its own. Just here, in the most barren and
      dreary tract of European history, all feudal privileges, all modern
      nobility, take their source. It is to this point that we trace the power
      of those princes who, nominally vassals, but really independent, long
      governed, with the titles of dukes, marquesses, and counts, almost every
      part of the dominions which had obeyed Charlemagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such or nearly such was the change which passed on the Mogul empire during
      the forty years which followed the death of Aurungzebe. A succession of
      nominal sovereigns, sunk in indolence and debauchery, sauntered away life
      in secluded palaces, chewing bang, fondling concubines, and listening to
      buffoons. A succession of ferocious invaders descended through the western
      passes, to prey on the defenceless wealth of Hindostan. A Persian
      conqueror crossed the Indus, marched through the gates of Delhi, and bore
      away in triumph those treasures of which the magnificence had astounded
      Roe <span class="pagenum">207</span><a name="link207" id="link207"></a>and
      Bernier, the Peacock Throne, on which the richest jewels of Golconda had
      been disposed by the most skilful hands of Europe, and the inestimable
      Mountain of Light, which, after many strange vicissitudes, lately shone in
      the bracelet of Runjeet Sing, and is now destined to adorn the hideous
      idol of Orissa. The Afghan soon followed to complete the work of
      devastation which the Persian had begun. The warlike tribes of Rajpootana
      threw off the Mussulman yoke. A band of mercenary soldiers occupied
      Rohilcund. The Seiks ruled on the Indus. The Jauts spread dismay along the
      Jumna. The highlands which border on the western sea-coast of India poured
      forth a yet more formidable race, a race which was long the terror of
      every native power, and which, after many desperate and doubtful
      struggles, yielded only to the fortune and genius of England. It was under
      the reign of Aurungzebe that this wild clan of plunderers first descended
      from their mountains; and soon after his death, every corner of his wide
      empire learned to tremble at the mighty name of the Malirattan. Many
      fertile viceroyalties were entirely subdued by them. Their dominions
      stretched across the peninsula from sea to sea. Mahratta captains reigned
      at Poonah, at Gualior, in Guzerat, in Berar, and in Tanjore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did they, though they had become great sovereigns, therefore cease to
      be freebooters. They still retained the predatory habits of their
      forefathers. Every region which was not subject to their rule was wasted
      by their incursions. Wherever their kettle-drams were heard, the peasant
      threw his bag of rice on his shoulder, hid his small savings in his
      girdle, and fled with his wife and children to the mountains or the
      jungles, to the milder neighbourhood of the hyæna and the tiger. Many
      provinces redeemed their harvests by the <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>payment of an annual ransom. Even the
      wretched phantom who still bore the imperial title stooped to pay this
      ignominious black-mail. The camp-fires of one rapacious leader were seen
      from the walls of the palace of Delhi. Another, at the head of his
      innumerable cavalry, descended year after year on the rice-fields of
      Bengal. Even the European factors trembled for their magazines. Less than
      a hundred years ago, it was thought necessary to fortify Calcutta against
      the horsemen of Berar, and the name of the Mahratta ditch still preserves
      the memory of the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever the viceroys of the Mogul retained authority they became
      sovereigns. They might still acknowledge in words the superiority of the
      house of Tamerlane; as a Count of Flanders or a Duke of Burgundy might
      have acknowledged the superiority of the most helpless driveller among the
      later Carlovingians. They might occasionally send to their titular
      sovereign a complimentary present, or solicit from him a title of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, however, they were no longer lieutenants removable at pleasure,
      but independent hereditary princes. In this way originated those great
      Mussulman houses which formerly ruled Bengal and the Carnatic, and those
      which still, though in a state of vassalage, exercise some of the powers
      of royalty at Lucknow and Hyderabad.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what was this confusion to end? Was the strife to continue during
      centuries? Was it to terminate in the rise of another great monarchy? Was
      the Mussulman or the Mahratta to be the Lord of India? Was another Baber
      to descend from the mountains, and to lead the hardy tribes of Cabul and
      Chorasan against a wealthier and less warlike race? None of these events
      seemed improbable. But scarcely any man, <span class="pagenum">209</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a>however sagacious, would have thought it
      possible that a trading company, separated from India by fifteen thousand
      miles of sea, and possessing in India only a few acres for purposes of
      commerce, would, in less than a hundred years, spread its empire from Cape
      Comorin to the eternal snow of the Himalayas; would compel Mahratta and
      Mahommedan to forget their mutual feuds in common subjection; would tame
      down even those wild races which had resisted the most powerful of the
      Moguls; and, having united under its laws a hundred millions of subjects,
      would carry its victorious arms far to the east of the Burrampooter, and
      far to the west of the Hydaspes, dictate terms of peace at the gates of
      Ava, and seat its vassal on the throne of Candahar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who first saw that it was possible to found an European empire on
      the ruins of the Mogul monarchy was Dupleix. His restless, capricious, and
      inventive mind had formed this scheme, at a time when the ablest servants
      of the English Company were busied only about invoices and bills of
      lading. Nor had he only proposed to himself the end. He had also a just
      and distinct view of the means by which it was to be attained. He clearly
      saw that the greatest force which the princes of India could bring into
      the field would be no match for a small body of men trained in the
      discipline, and guided by the tactics, of the West. He saw also that the
      natives of India might, under European commanders, be formed into armies,
      such as Saxe or Frederic would be proud to command. He was perfectly aware
      that the most easy and convenient way in which an European adventurer
      could exercise sovereignty in India, was to govern the motions, and to
      speak through the mouth <span class="pagenum">210</span><a name="link210"
       id="link210"></a>of some glittering puppet dignified by the title of Nabob
      or Nizam. The arts both of war and policy, which a few years later were
      employed with such signal success by the English, were first understood
      and practised by this ingenious and aspiring Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of India was such that scarcely any aggression could be
      without a pretext, either in old laws or in recent practice. All rights
      were in a state of utter uncertainty; and the Europeans who took part in
      the disputes of the natives confounded the confusion, by applying to
      Asiatic politics the public law of the West and analogies drawn from the
      feudal system. If it was convenient to treat a Nabob as an independent
      prince, there was an excellent plea for doing so. He was independent in
      fact. If it was convenient to treat him as a mere deputy of the Court of
      Delhi, there was no difficulty; for he was so in theory. If it was
      convenient to consider his office as an hereditary dignity, or as a
      dignity held during life only, or as a dignity held only during the good
      pleasure of the Mogul, arguments and precedents might be found for every
      one of those views. The party who had the heir of Baber in their hands
      represented him as the undoubted, the legitimate, the absolute sovereign,
      whom all subordinate authorities were bound to obey. The party against
      whom his name was used did not want plausible pretexts for maintaining
      that the empire was in fact dissolved, and that, though it might be decent
      to treat the Mogul with respect, as a venerable relic of an order of
      things which had passed away, it was absurd to regard him as the real
      master of Hindostan.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1748, died one of the most powerful of <span class="pagenum">211</span><a
      name="link211" id="link211"></a>the new masters of India, the great Nizam
      al Mulk, Viceroy of the Deccan. His authority descended to his son, Nazir
      Jung. Of the provinces subject to this high functionary, the Carnatic was
      the wealthiest and the most extensive. It was governed by an ancient
      Nabob, whose name the English corrupted into Anaverdy Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were pretenders to the government both of the viceroyalty and of
      the subordinate province. Mirzaplia Jung, a grandson of Nizam al Mulk,
      appeared as the competitor of Nazir Jung. Chunda Sahib, son-in-law of a
      former Nabob of the Carnatic, disputed the title of Anaverdy Khan. In the
      unsettled state of Indian law it was easy for both Mirzapha Jung and
      Chunda Sahib to make out something like a claim of right. In a society
      altogether disorganized, they had no difficulty in finding greedy
      adventurers to follow their standards. They united their interests,
      invaded the Carnatic, and applied for assistance to the French, whose fame
      had been raised by their success against the English in the recent war on
      the coast of Coromandel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have happened more pleasing to the subtile and ambitious
      Dupleix. To make a Nabob of the Carnatic, to make a Viceroy of the Deccan,
      to rule under their names the whole of southern India; this was indeed an
      attractive prospect. He allied himself with the pretenders, and sent four
      hundred French soldiers, and two thousand sepoys, disciplined after the
      European fashion, to the assistance of his confederates. A battle was
      fought. The French distinguished themselves greatly. Anaverdy Khan was
      defeated and slain. His son, Mahommed Ali, who was afterwards well known
      in England as the Nabob of Arcot, and <span class="pagenum">212</span><a
      name="link212" id="link212"></a>who owes to the eloquence of Burke a most
      unenviable immortality, fled with a scanty remnant of his army to
      Trichinopoly; and the conquerors became at once masters of almost every
      part of the Carnatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was but the beginning of the greatness of Dupleix.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some months of fighting, negotiation, and intrigue, his ability and
      good fortune seemed to have prevailed everywhere. Nazir Jung perished by
      the hands of his own followers; Mirzapha Jung was master of the Deccan;
      and the triumph of French arms and French policy was complete. At
      Pondicherry all was exultation and festivity. Salutes were fired from the
      batteries, and Te Deum sung in the churches. The new Nizam came thither to
      visit his allies; and the ceremony of his installation was performed there
      with great pomp. Dupleix, dressed in the garb worn by Mahommedans of the
      highest rank, entered the town in the same palanquin with the Nizam, and,
      in the pageant which followed, took precedence of all the court. He was
      declared Governor of India from the river Kristna to Cape Comorin, a
      country about as large as France, with authority superior even to that of
      Chunda Sahib. He was intrusted with the command of seven thousand cavalry.
      It was announced that no mint would be suffered to exist in the Carnatic
      except that at Pondicherry. A large portion of the treasures which former
      Viceroys of the Deccan had accumulated found its way into the coffers of
      the French governor. It was rumoured that he had received two hundred
      thousand pounds sterling in money, besides many valuable jewels. In fact,
      there could scarcely be any limit to his gains. He now ruled thirty
      millions of people with almost absolute power. No honour or emolument
      could be obtained from the government but by his intervention <span
      class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213" id="link213"></a>No petition,
      unless signed by him, was perused by the Nizam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirzapha Jung survived his elevation only a few months. But another prince
      of the same house was raised to the throne by French influence, and
      ratified all the promises of his predecessor. Dupleix was now the greatest
      potentate in India. His countrymen boasted that his name was mentioned
      with awe even in the chambers of the palace of Delhi. The native
      population looked with amazement on the progress which, in the short space
      of four years, an European adventurer had made towards dominion in Asia.
      Nor was the vain-glorious Frenchman content with the reality of power. He
      loved to display his greatness with arrogant ostentation before the eyes
      of his subjects and of his rivals. Near the spot where his policy had
      obtained its chief triumph, by the fall of Nazir Jung and the elevation of
      Mirzapha, he determined to erect a column, on the four sides of which four
      pompous inscriptions, in four languages, should proclaim his glory to all
      the nations of the East. Medals stamped with emblems of his successes were
      buried beneath the foundations of this stately pillar, and round it arose
      a town bearing the haughty name of Dupleix Fatihabad, which is, being
      interpreted, the City of the Victory of Dupleix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English had made some feeble and irresolute attempts to stop the rapid
      and brilliant career of the rival Company, and continued to recognize
      Mahommed Ali as Nabob of the Carnatic. But the dominions of Mahommed Ali
      consisted of Trichinopoly alone; and Trichinopoly was now invested by
      Chunda Sahib and his French auxiliaries. To raise the siege seemed
      impossible. The small force which was then at Madras had no commander.
      Major Lawrence had returned to <span class="pagenum">214</span><a
      name="link214" id="link214"></a>England; and not a single officer of
      established character remained in the settlement. The natives had learned
      to look with contempt on the mighty nation which was soon to conquer and
      to rule them. They had seen the French colours flying on Fort St. George;
      they had seen the chiefs of the English factory led in triumph through the
      streets of Pondicherry; they had seen the arms and counsels of Dupleix
      everywhere successful, while the opposition which the authorities of
      Madras had made to his progress, had served only to expose their own
      weakness, and to heighten his glory. At this moment, the valour and genius
      of an obscure English youth suddenly turned the tide of fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive was now twenty-five years old. After hesitating for some time
      between a military and a commercial life, he had at length been placed in
      a post which partook of both characters, that of commissary to the troops,
      with the rank of captain. The present emergency called forth all his
      powers. He represented to his superiors that unless some vigorous effort
      were made, Trichinopoly would fall, the house of Anaverdy Khan would
      perish, and the French would become the real masters of the whole
      peninsula of India. It was absolutely necessary to strike some daring
      blow. If an attack were made on Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, and
      the favourite residence of the Nabobs, it was not impossible that the
      siege of Trichinopoly would be raised. The heads of the English
      settlement, now thoroughly alarmed by the success of Dupleix, and
      apprehensive that, in the event of a new war between France and Great
      Britain, Madras would be instantly taken and destroyed, approved of
      Clive&rsquo;s plan, and intrusted the execution of it to himself. The young
      captain was put at the head of two hundred English soldiers, <span
      class="pagenum">215</span><a name="link215" id="link215"></a>and three
      hundred sepoys, armed and disciplined after the European fashion. Of the
      eight officers who commanded this little force under him, only two had
      ever been in action, and four of the eight were factors of the company,
      whom Clive&rsquo;s example had induced to offer their services. The weather was
      stormy; but Clive pushed on, through thunder, lightning, and rain, to the
      gates of Arcot. The garrison, in a panic, evacuated the fort, and the
      English entered it without a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clive well knew that he should not be suffered to retain undisturbed
      possession of his conquest. He instantly began to collect provisions, to
      throw up works, and to make preparations for sustaining a siege. The
      garrison, which had fled at his approach, had now recovered from its
      dismay, and, having been swollen by large reinforcements from the
      neighbourhood to a force of three thousand men, encamped close to the
      town. At dead of night, Clive marched out of the fort, attacked the camp
      by surprise, slew great numbers, dispersed the rest, and returned to his
      quarters without having lost a single man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligence of these events was soon carried to Chunda Sahib, who,
      with his French allies, was besieging Trichinopoly. He immediately
      detached four thousand men from his camp, and sent them to Arcot. They
      were speedily joined by the remains of the force which Clive had lately
      scattered. They were further strengthened by two thousand men from
      Vellore, and by a still more important reinforcement of a hundred and
      fifty French soldiers whom Dupleix despatched from Pondicherry. The whole
      of this army, amounting to about ten thousand men, was under the command
      of Rajah Sahib, son of Chunda Sahib. <span class="pagenum">216</span><a
      name="link216" id="link216"></a>Rajah Sahib proceeded to invest the fort
      of Arcot, which seemed quite incapable of sustaining a siege. The walls
      were ruinous, the ditches dry, the ramparts too narrow to admit the guns,
      the battlements too low to protect the soldiers. The little garrison had
      been greatly reduced by casualties. It now consisted of a hundred and
      twenty Europeans and two hundred sepoys. Only four officers were left; the
      stock of provisions was scanty; and the commander, who had to conduct the
      defence under circumstances so discouraging, was a young man of five and
      twenty, who had been bred a book-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      During fifty days the siege went on. During fifty days the young captain
      maintained the defence, with a firmness, vigilance, and ability, which
      would have done honour to the oldest marshal in Europe. The breach,
      however, increased day by day. The garrison began to feel the pressure of
      hunger. Under such circumstances, any troops so scantily provided with
      officers might have been expected to show signs of insubordination; and
      the danger was peculiarly great in a force composed of men differing
      widely from each other in extraction, colour, language, manners, and
      religion. But the devotion of the little band to its chief surpassed any
      thing that is related of the Tenth Legion of Cæsar, or of the Old Guard of
      Napoleon. The sepoys came to Clive, not to complain of their scanty fare,
      but to propose that all the grain should be given to the Europeans, who
      required more nourishment than the natives of Asia. The thin gruel, they
      said, which was strained away from the rice, would suffice for themselves.
      History contains no more touching instance of military fidelity, or of the
      influence of a commanding mind. <span class="pagenum">217</span><a
      name="link217" id="link217"></a>An attempt made by the government of
      Madras to relieve the place had failed. But there was hope from another
      quarter. A body of six thousand Mahrattas, half soldiers, half robbers,
      under the command of a chief named Morari Row, had been hired to assist
      Mahommed Ali; but thinking the French power irresistible, and the triumph
      of Chunda Sahib certain, they had hitherto remained inactive on the
      frontiers of the Carnatic. The fame of the defence of Arcot roused them
      from their torpor. Morari Row declared that he had never before believed
      that Englishmen could fight, but that he would willingly help them since
      he saw that they had spirit to help themselves. Rajah Sahib learned that
      the Mahrattas were in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary for him to be expeditious. He first tried negotiation. He
      offered large bribes to Clive, which were rejected with scorn. He vowed
      that, if his proposals were not accepted, he would instantly storm the
      fort, and put every man in it to the sword. Clive told him in reply, with
      characteristic haughtiness, that his father was an usurper, that his army
      was a rabble, and that he would do well to think twice before he sent such
      poltroons into a breach defended by English soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rajah Sahib determined to storm the fort. The day was well suited to a
      bold military enterprise. It was the great Mahommedan festival which is
      sacred to the memory of Hosein the son of Ali. The history of Islam
      contains nothing more touching than the event which gave rise to that
      solemnity. The mournful legend relates how the chief of the Fatimites,
      when all his brave followers had perished round him, drank his latest
      draught of water, and uttered his latest prayer, how the assassins carried
      his head in triumph, how the <span class="pagenum">218</span><a
      name="link218" id="link218"></a>tyrant smote the lifeless lips with his
      staff, and how a few old men recollected with tears that they had seen
      those lips pressed to the lips of the Prophet of God. After the lapse of
      near twelve centuries, the recurrence of this solemn season excites the
      fiercest and saddest emotions in the bosoms of the devout Moslem of India.
      They work themselves up to such agonies of rage and lamentation that some,
      it is said, have given up the ghost from the mere effect of mental
      excitement. They believe that whoever, during this festival, falls in arms
      against the infidels, atones by his death for all the sins of his life,
      and passes at once to the garden of the Houris. It was at this time that
      Rajah Sahib determined to assault Arcot. Stimulating drugs were employed
      to aid the effect of religious zeal, and the besiegers, drunk with
      enthusiasm, drunk with bang, rushed furiously to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive had received secret intelligence of the design, had made his
      arrangements, and, exhausted by fatigue, had thrown himself on his bed. He
      was awakened by the alarm, and was instantly at his post. The enemy
      advanced, driving before them elephants whose foreheads were armed with
      iron plates. It was expected that the gates would yield to the shock of
      these living battering-rams. But the huge beasts no sooner felt the
      English musket balls than they turned round, and rushed furiously away,
      trampling on the multitude which had urged them forward. A raft was
      launched on the water which filled one part of the ditch. Clive,
      perceiving that his gunners at that post did not understand their
      business, took the management of a piece of artillery himself, and cleared
      the raft in a few minutes. Where the moat was dry the assailants mounted
      with great boldness, but they were received with a fire so heavy <span
      class="pagenum">219</span><a name="link219" id="link219"></a>and so well
      directed, that it soon quelled the courage even of fanaticism and of
      intoxication. The rear ranks of the English kept the front ranks supplied
      with a constant succession of loaded muskets, and every shot told on the
      living mass below. After three desperate onsets, the besiegers retired
      behind the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle lasted about an hour. Four hundred of the assailants fell.
      The garrison lost only five or six men. The besieged passed an anxious
      night, looking for a renewal of the attack. But when day broke, the enemy
      were no more to be seen. They had retired, leaving to the English several
      guns and a large quantity of ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was received at Fort St. George with transports of joy and pride.
      Clive was justly regarded as a man equal to any command. Two hundred
      English soldiers and seven hundred sepoys were sent to him, and with this
      force he instantly commenced offensive operations. He took the fort of
      Timery, effected a junction with a division of Morari Row&rsquo;s army, and
      hastened, by forced marches, to attack Rajah Sahib, who was at the head of
      about five thousand men, of whom three hundred were French. The action was
      sharp; but Clive gained a complete victory. The military chest of Rajah
      Sahib fell into the hands of the conquerors. Six hundred sepoys who had
      served in the enemy&rsquo;s army, came over to Clive&rsquo;s quarters and were taken
      into the British service. Conjeveram surrendered without a blow. The
      governor of Arnee deserted Chunda Sahib, and recognised the title of
      Mahommed Ali.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the entire direction of the war been intrusted to Clive, it would
      probably have been brought to a speedy close. But the timidity and
      incapacity which <span class="pagenum">220</span><a name="link220"
       id="link220"></a>appeared in all the movements of the English, except
      where he was personally present, protracted the struggle. The Mahrattas
      muttered that his soldiers were of a different race from the British whom
      they found elsewhere. The effect of this languor was that in no long time
      Rajah Sahib, at the head of a considerable army, in which were four
      hundred French troops, appeared almost under the guns of Fort St. George,
      and laid waste the villas and gardens of the gentlemen of the English
      settlement. But he was again encountered and defeated by Clive. More than
      a hundred of the French were killed or taken, a loss more serious than
      that of thousands of natives. The victorious army inarched from the field
      of battle to Fort St. David. On the road lay the City of the Victory of
      Dupleix, and the stately monument which was designed to commemorate the
      triumphs of France in the East. Clive ordered both the city and the
      monument to be rased to the ground. He was induced, we believe, to take
      this step, not by personal or national malevolence, but by a just and
      profound policy. The town and its pompous name, the pillar and its
      vaunting inscriptions, were among the devices by which Dupleix had laid
      the public mind of India under a spell. This spell it was Clive&rsquo;s business
      to break. The natives had been taught that France was confessedly the
      first power in Europe, and that the English did not presume to dispute her
      supremacy. No measure could be more effectual for the removing of this
      delusion than the public and solemn demolition of the French trophies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The government of Madras, encouraged by these events, determined to send a
      strong detachment, under Clive, to reinforce the garrison of Trichinopoly.
      But <span class="pagenum">221</span><a name="link221" id="link221"></a>just
      at this conjuncture, Major Lawrence arrived from England, and assumed the
      chief command. From the waywardness and impatience of control which had
      characterized Clive, both at school and in the counting-house, it might
      have been expected that he would not, after such achievements, act with
      zeal and good humour in a subordinate capacity. But Lawrence had early
      treated him with kindness; and it is bare justice to Clive to say that,
      proud and overbearing as he was, kindness was never thrown away upon him.
      He cheerfully placed himself under the orders of his old friend, and
      exerted himself as strenuously in the second post as he could have done in
      the first. Lawrence well knew the value of such assistance. Though himself
      gifted with no intellectual faculty higher than plain good sense, he fully
      appreciated the powers of his brilliant coadjutor. Though he had made a
      methodical study of military tactics, and, like all men regularly bred to
      a profession, was disposed to look with disdain on interlopers, he had yet
      liberality enough to acknowledge that Clive was an exception to common
      rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;are pleased to term Captain Clive fortunate and
      lucky; but, in my opinion, from the knowledge I have of the gentleman, he
      deserved and might expect from his conduct every thing as it fell out;&mdash;a
      man of an undaunted resolution, of a cool temper, and of a presence of
      mind which never left him in the greatest danger&mdash;born a soldier;
      for, without a military education of any sort, or much conversing with any
      of the profession, from his judgment and good sense, he led on an army
      like an experienced officer and a brave soldier, with a prudence that
      certainly warranted success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French had no commander to oppose to the two <span class="pagenum">222</span><a
      name="link222" id="link222"></a>friends. Dupleix, not inferior in talents
      for negotiation and intrigue to any European who has borne a part in the
      revolutions of India, was ill qualified to direct in person military
      operations. He had not been bred a soldier, and had no inclination to
      become one. His enemies accused him of personal cowardice; and he defended
      himself in a strain worthy of Captain Bobadil.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept away from shot, he said, because silence and tranquillity were
      propitious to his genius, and he found it difficult to pursue his
      meditations amidst the noise of fire-arms. He was thus under the necessity
      of intrusting to others the execution of his great warlike designs; and he
      bitterly complained that he was ill served. He had indeed been assisted by
      one officer of eminent merit, the celebrated Bussy. But Bussy had marched
      northward with the Nizam, and was fully employed in looking after his own
      interests, and those of France, at the court of that prince. Among the
      officers who remained with Dupleix, there was not a single man of
      capacity; and many of them were boys, at whose ignorance and folly the
      common soldiers laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English triumphed everywhere. The besiegers of Trichinopoly were
      themselves besieged and compelled to capitulate. Chunda Sahib fell into
      the hands of the Mahrattas, and was put to death, at the instigation
      probably of his competitor, Mahommed Ali. The spirit of Dupleix, however,
      was unconquerable, and his resources inexhaustible. From his employers in
      Europe he no longer received help or countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They condemned his policy. They gave him no pecuniary assistance. They
      sent him for troops only the sweepings of the galleys. Yet still he
      persisted, intrigued, bribed, promised, lavished his private fortune,
      <span class="pagenum">223</span><a name="link223" id="link223"></a>strained
      his credit, procured new diplomas from Delhi, raised up new enemies to the
      government of Madras on every side, and found tools even among the allies
      of the English Company. But all was in vain. Slowly, but steadily, the
      power of Britain continued to increase, and that of France to decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The health of Clive had never been good during his residence in India; and
      his constitution was now so much impaired that he determined to return to
      England. Before his departure he undertook a service of considerable
      difficulty, and performed it with his usual vigour and dexterity. The
      forts of Covelong and Chingleput were occupied by French garrisons. It was
      determined to send a force against them. But the only force available for
      this purpose was of such a description that no officer but Clive would
      risk his reputation by commanding it. It consisted of five hundred newly
      levied sepoys, and two hundred recruits who had just landed from England,
      and who were the worst and lowest wretches that the Company&rsquo;s crimps could
      pick up in the flash-houses of London. Clive, ill and exhausted as he was,
      undertook to make an army of this undisciplined rabble, and marched with
      them to Cove-long. A shot from the fort killed one of these extraordinary
      soldiers; on which all the rest faced about and ran away, and it was with
      the greatest difficulty that Clive rallied them. On another occasion, the
      noise of a gun terrified the sentinels so much that one of them was found,
      some hours later, at the bottom of a well. Clive gradually accustomed them
      to danger, and, by exposing himself constantly in the most perilous
      situations, shamed them into courage. He at length succeeded in forming a
      respectable force out of his unpromising materials. Covelong fell. Clive
      learned <span class="pagenum">224</span><a name="link224" id="link224"></a>that
      a strong: detachment was marching: to relieve it from Chingleput. He took
      measures to prevent the enemy from learning that they were too late, laid
      an ambuscade for them on the road, killed a hundred of them with one fire,
      took three hundred prisoners, pursued the fugitives to the gates of
      Chingleput, laid siege instantly to that fastness, reputed one of the
      strongest in India, made a breach, and was on the point of storming, when
      the French commandant capitulated and retired with his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive returned to Madras victorious, but in a state of health which
      rendered it impossible for him to remain there long. He married at this
      time a young lady of the name of Maskelyne, sister of the eminent
      mathematician, who long held the post of Astronomer Royal. She is
      described as handsome and accomplished; and her husband&rsquo;s letters, it is
      said, contain proofs that he was devotedly attached to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately after the marriage, Clive embarked with his bride for
      England. He returned a very different person from the poor slighted boy
      who had been sent out ten years before to seek his fortune. He was only
      twenty-seven; yet his country already respected him as one of her first
      soldiers. There was then general peace in Europe. The Carnatic was the
      only part of the world where the English and French were in arms against
      each other. The vast schemes of Dupleix had excited no small uneasiness in
      the city of London; and the rapid turn of fortune, which was chiefly owing
      to the courage and talents of Clive, had been hailed with great delight.
      The young captain was known at the India House by the honourable nickname
      of General Clive, and was toasted by that appellation at the feasts of the
      Directors. On his arrival in <span class="pagenum">225</span><a
      name="link225" id="link225"></a>England, he found himself an object of
      general interest and admiration. The East India Company thanked him for
      his services in the warmest terms, and bestowed on him a sword set with
      diamonds. With rare delicacy, he refused to receive this token of
      gratitude, unless a similar compliment were paid to his friend and
      commander, Lawrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may easily be supposed that Clive was most cordially welcomed home by
      his family, who were delighted by his success, though they seem to have
      been hardly able to comprehend how their naughty idle Bobby had become so
      great a man. His father had been singularly hard of belief. Not until the
      news of the defence of Arcot arrived in England was the old gentleman
      heard to growl out that, after all, the booby had something in him. His
      expressions of approbation became stronger and stronger as news arrived of
      one brilliant exploit after another; and he was at length immoderately
      fond and proud of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive&rsquo;s relations had very substantial reasons for rejoicing at his
      return. Considerable sums of prize money had fallen to his share; and he
      had brought home a moderate fortune, part of which he expended in
      extricating his father from pecuniary difficulties, and in redeeming the
      family estate. The remainder he appears to have dissipated in the course
      of about two years. He lived splendidly, dressed gaily even for those
      times, kept a carriage and saddle horses, and, not content with these ways
      of getting rid of his money, resorted to the most speedy and effectual of
      all modes of evacuation, a contested election followed by a petition.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the general election of 1754, the government was in a very
      singular state. There was <span class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226"
       id="link226"></a>scarcely any formal opposition. The Jacobites had been
      cowed by the issue of the last rebellion. The Tory party had fallen into
      utter contempt. It had been deserted by all the men of talents who had
      belonged to it, and had scarcely given a symptom of life during some
      years. The small faction which had been held together by the influence and
      promises of Prince Frederic, had been dispersed by his death. Almost every
      public man of distinguished talents in the kingdom, whatever his early
      connections might have been, was in office, and called himself a Whig. But
      this extraordinary appearance of concord was quite delusive. The
      administration itself was distracted by bitter enmities and conflicting
      pretensions. The chief object of its members was to depress and supplant
      each other. The prime minister, Newcastle, weak, timid, jealous, and
      perfidious, was at once detested and despised by some of the most
      important members of his government, and by none more than by Henry Fox,
      the Secretary at War. This able, daring, and ambitious man seized every
      opportunity of crossing the First Lord of the Treasury, from whom he well
      knew that he had little to dread and little to hope; for Newcastle was
      through life equally afraid of breaking with men of parts and of promoting
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newcastle had set his heart on returning two members for St. Michael, one
      of those wretched Cornish boroughs which were swept away by the Reform Act
      in 1832. He was opposed by Lord Sandwich, whose influence had long been
      paramount there: and Fox exerted himself strenuously in Sandwich&rsquo;s behalf.
      Clive, who had been introduced to Fox, and very kindly received by him,
      was brought forward on the Sandwich interest, and was returned. But a
      petition <span class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227" id="link227"></a>was
      presented against the return, and was backed by the whole influence of the
      Duke of Newcastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was heard, according to the usage of that time, before a
      committee of the whole House. Questions respecting elections were then
      considered merely as party questions. Judicial impartiality was not even
      affected. Sir Robert Walpole was in the habit of saying openly that, in
      election battles, there ought to be no quarter. On the present occasion
      the excitement was great. The matter really at issue was, not whether
      Clive had been properly or improperly returned, but whether Newcastle or
      Fox was to be master of the new House of Commons, and consequently first
      minister. The contest was long and obstinate, and success seemed to lean
      sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other. Fox put forth all his
      rare powers of debate, beat half the lawyers in the House at their own
      weapons, and earned division after division against the whole influence of
      the Treasury. The committee decided in Clive&rsquo;s favour. But when the
      resolution was reported to the House, things took a different course. The
      remnant of the Tory Opposition, contemptible as it was, had yet sufficient
      weight to turn the scale between the nicely balanced parties of Newcastle
      and Fox. Newcastle the Tories could only despise. Fox they hated, as the
      boldest and most subtle politician and the ablest debater among the-Whigs,
      as the steady friend of Walpole, as the devoted adherent of the Duke of
      Cumberland. After wavering till the last moment, they determined to vote
      in a body with the Prime Minister&rsquo;s friends. The consequence was that the
      House, by a small majority, rescinded the decision of the committee, and
      Clive was unseated. <span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228"
       id="link228"></a>Ejected from Parliament, and straitened in his means, he
      naturally began to look again towards India. The Company and the
      Government were eager to avail themselves of his services. A treaty
      favourable to England had indeed been concluded in the Carnatic. Dupleix
      had been superseded, and had returned with the wreck of his immense
      fortune to Europe, where calumny and chicanery soon hunted him to his
      grave. But many signs indicated that a war between France and Great
      Britain was at hand; and it was therefore thought desirable to send an
      able commander to the Company&rsquo;s settlements in India. The Directors
      appointed Clive governor of Fort St. David. The King gave him the
      commission of a lieutenant-colonel in the British army, and in 1755 he
      again sailed for Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first service on which he was employed after his return to the East
      was the reduction of the stronghold of Gheriah. This fortress, built on a
      craggy promontory, and almost surrounded by the ocean, was the den of a
      pirate named Angria, whose barks had long been the terror of the Arabian
      Gulf. Admiral Watson, who commanded the English squadron in the Eastern
      seas, burned Angria&rsquo;s fleet, while Clive attacked the fastness by land.
      The place soon fell, and a booty of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds
      sterling was divided among the conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this exploit, Clive proceeded to his government of Fort St. David.
      Before he had been there two months, he received intelligence which called
      forth all the energy of his bold and active mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the provinces which had been subject to the house of Tamerlane, the
      wealthiest was Bengal. No part of India possessed such natural advantages
      both <span class="pagenum">229</span><a name="link229" id="link229"></a>for
      agriculture and for commerce. The Ganges, rushing through a hundred
      channels to the sea, has formed a vast plain of rich mould which, even
      under the tropical sky, rivals the verdure of an English April. The rice
      fields yield an increase such as is elsewhere unknown. Spices, sugar,
      vegetable oils, are produced with marvellous exuberance. The rivers afford
      an inexhaustible supply of fish. The desolate islands along the sea-coast,
      overgrown by noxious vegetation, and swarming with deer and tigers, supply
      the cultivated districts with abundance of salt. The great stream which
      fertilises the soil is, at the same time, the chief highway of Eastern
      commerce. On its banks, and on those of its tributary waters, are the
      wealthiest marts, the most splendid capitals, and the most sacred shrines
      of India. The tyranny of man had for ages struggled in vain against the
      overflowing bounty of nature. In spite of the Mussulman despot and of the
      Mahratta freebooter, Bengal was known through the East as the garden of
      Eden, as the rich kingdom. Its population multiplied exceedingly. Distant
      provinces were nourished from the overflowing of its granaries; and the
      noble ladies of London and Paris were clothed in the delicate produce of
      its looms. The race by whom this rich tract was peopled, enervated by a
      soft climate and accustomed to peaceful employments, bore the same
      relation to other Asiatics which the Asiatics generally bear to the bold
      and energetic children of Europe. The Castilians have a proverb, that in
      Valencia the earth is water and the men women; and the description is at
      least equally applicable to the vast plain of the Lower Ganges. Whatever
      the Bengalee does he does languidly. His favourite pursuits are sedentary.
      He shrinks from bodily exertion; <span class="pagenum">230</span><a
      name="link230" id="link230"></a>and, though voluble in dispute, and
      singularly pertinacious in the war of chicane, he seldom engages in a
      personal conflict, and scarcely ever enlists as a soldier. We doubt
      whether there be a hundred genuine Bengalees in the whole army of the East
      India Company. There never, perhaps, existed a people so thoroughly fitted
      by nature and by habit for a foreign yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great commercial companies of Europe had long possessed factories in
      Bengal. The French were settled, as they still are, at Chandernagore on
      the Hoogley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher up the stream the Dutch traders held Chinsurah. Nearer to the sea,
      the English had built Fort William. A church and ample warehouses rose in
      the vicinity. A row of spacious houses, belonging to the chief factors of
      the East India Company, lined the banks of the river; and in the
      neighbourhood had sprung up a large and busy native town, where some
      Hindoo merchants of great opulence had fixed their abode. But the tract
      now covered by the palaces of Chowringhee contained only a few miserable
      huts thatched with straw. A jungle, abandoned to waterfowl and alligators,
      covered the site of the present Citadel, and the Course, which is now
      daily crowded at sunset with the gayest equipages of Calcutta. For the
      ground on which the settlement stood, the English, like other great
      landholders, paid rent to the government; and they were, like other great
      landholders, permitted to exercise a certain jurisdiction within their
      domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great province of Bengal, together with Orissa and Bahar, had long
      been governed by a viceroy, whom the English called Aliverdy Khan, and
      who, like the other viceroys of the Mogul, had become virtually
      independent. He died in 1756, and the <span class="pagenum">231</span><a
      name="link231" id="link231"></a>sovereignty descended to his grandson, a
      youth under twenty years of age, who bore the name of Surajah Dowlah.
      Oriental despots are perhaps the worst class of human beings; and this
      unhappy boy was one of the worst specimens of his class. His understanding
      was naturally feeble, and his temper naturally unamiable. His education
      had been such as would have enervated even a vigorous intellect, and
      perverted even a generous disposition. He was unreasonable, because nobody
      ever dared to reason with him, and selfish, because he had never been made
      to feel himself dependent on the good will of others. Early debauchery had
      unnerved his body and his mind. He indulged immoderately in the use of
      ardent spirits, which inflamed his weak brain almost to madness. His
      chosen companions were flatterers sprung from the dregs of the people, and
      recommended by nothing but buffoonery and servility. It is said that he
      had arrived at that last stage of human depravity, when cruelty becomes
      pleasing for its own sake, when the sight of pain as pain, where no
      advantage is to be gained, no offence punished, no danger averted, is an
      agreeable excitement. It had early been his amusement to torture beasts
      and birds; and, when he grew up, he enjoyed with still keener relish the
      misery of his fellow-creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a child Surajah Dowlah had hated the English. It was his whim to do
      so; and his whims were never opposed. He had also formed a very
      exaggerated notion of the wealth which might be obtained by plundering
      them; and his feeble and uncultivated mind was incapable of perceiving
      that the riches of Calcutta, had they been even greater than he imagined,
      would not compensate him for what he must lose, if the European <span
      class="pagenum">232</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>trade, of
      which Bengal was a chief seat, should be driven by his violence to some
      other quarter. Pretexts for a quarrel were readily found. The English, in
      expectation of a war with France, had begun to fortify their settlement
      without special permission from the Nabob. A rich native, whom he longed
      to plunder, had taken refuge at Calcutta, and had not been delivered up.
      On such grounds as these Surajah Dowlali marched with a great army against
      Fort William.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants of the Company at Madras had been forced by Dupleix to become
      statesmen and soldiers. Those in Bengal were still mere traders, and were
      terrified and bewildered by the approaching danger. The governor, who had
      heard much of Surajah Dowlah&rsquo;s cruelty, was frightened out of his wits,
      jumped into a boat, and took refuge in the nearest ship. The military
      commandant thought that he could not do better than follow so good an
      example. The fort was taken after a feeble resistance; and great numbers
      of the English fell into the hands of the conquerors. The Nabob seated
      himself with regal pomp in the principal hall of the factory, and ordered
      Mr. Holwell, the first in rank among the prisoners, to be brought before
      him. His Highness talked about the insolence of the English, and grumbled
      at the smallness of the treasure which he had found; but promised to spare
      their lives, and retired to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then was committed that great crime, memorable for its singular atrocity,
      memorable for the tremendous retribution by which it was followed. The
      English captives were left at the mercy of the guards, and the guards
      determined to secure them for the night in the prison of the garrison, a
      chamber known by the fearful name of the Black Hole. Even for a single
      European <span class="pagenum">233</span><a name="link233" id="link233"></a>malefactor,
      that dungeon would, in such a climate, have been too close and narrow. The
      space was only twenty feet square. The air-holes were small and
      obstructed. It was the summer solstice, the season when the fierce heat of
      Bengal can scarcely be rendered tolerable to natives of England by lofty
      halls and by the constant waving of fans. The number of the prisoners was
      one hundred and forty-six. When they were ordered to enter the cell, they
      imagined that the soldiers were joking; and, being in high spirits on
      account of the promise of the Nabob to spare their lives, they laughed and
      jested at the absurdity of the notion. They soon discovered their mistake.
      They expostulated; they entreated; but in vain. The guards threatened to
      cut down all who hesitated. The captives were driven into the cell at the
      point of the sword, and the door was instantly shut and locked upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in history or fiction, not even the story which Ugolino told in
      the sea of everlasting ice, after he had wiped his bloody lips on the
      scalp of his murderer, approaches the horrors which were recounted by the
      few survivors of that night. They cried for mercy. They strove to burst
      the door. Holwell who, even in that extremity, retained some presence of
      mind, offered large bribes to the gaolers. But the answer was that nothing
      could be done without the Nabob&rsquo;s orders, that the Nabob was asleep, and
      that he would be angry if anybody woke him. Then the prisoners went mad
      with despair. They trampled each other down, fought for the places at the
      windows, fought for the pittance of water with which the cruel mercy of
      the murderers mocked their agonies, raved, prayed, blasphemed, implored
      the guards to fire among them. The gaolers in the mean time held lights to
      the bars, and shouted with <span class="pagenum">234</span><a
      name="link234" id="link234"></a>laughter at the frantic struggles of their
      victims. At length the tumult died away in low gaspings and moanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day broke. The Nabob had slept off his debauch, and permitted the door
      to be opened. But it was some time before the soldiers could make a lane
      for the survivors, by piling up on each side the heaps of corpses on which
      the burning climate had already begun to do its loathsome work. When at
      length a passage was made, twenty-three ghastly figures, such as their own
      mothers would not have known, staggered one by one out of the
      charnel-house. A pit was instantly dug. The dead bodies, a hundred and
      twenty-three in number, were flung into it promiscuously and covered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these things which, after the lapse of more than eighty years, cannot
      be told or read without horror, awakened neither remorse nor pity in the
      bosom of the savage Nabob. He inflicted no punishment on the murderers. He
      showed no tenderness to the survivors. Some of them, indeed, from whom
      nothing was to be got, were suffered to depart; but those from whom it was
      thought that any thing could be extorted were treated with execrable
      cruelty. Holwell, unable to walk, was carried before the tyrant, who
      reproached him, threatened him, and sent him up the country in irons,
      together with some other gentlemen who were suspected of knowing more than
      they chose to tell about the treasures of the Company. These persons,
      still bowed down by the sufferings of that great agony, were lodged in
      miserable sheds, and fed only with grain and water, till at length the
      intercessions of the female relations of the Nabob procured their release.
      One Englishwoman had survived that night. She was placed in the harem of
      the Prince at Moorshedabad. <span class="pagenum">235</span><a
      name="link235" id="link235"></a>Surajah Dowlah, in the mean time, sent
      letters to his nominal sovereign at Delhi, describing the late conquest in
      the most pompous language. He placed a garrison in Fort William, forbade
      Englishmen to dwell in the neighbourhood, and directed that, in memory of
      his great actions, Calcutta should thenceforward be called Alinagore, that
      is to say, the Port of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In August the news of the fall of Calcutta reached Madras, and excited the
      fiercest and bitterest resentment. The cry of the whole settlement was for
      vengeance. Within forty-eight hours after the arrival of the intelligence
      it was determined that an expedition should be sent to the Hoogley, and
      that Clive should be at the head of the land forces. The naval armament
      was under the command of Admiral Watson. Nine hundred English infantry,
      fine troops and full of spirit, and fifteen hundred sepoys, composed the
      army which sailed to punish a Prince who had more subjects than Lewis the
      Fifteenth or the Empress Maria Theresa. In October the expedition sailed;
      but it had to make its way against adverse winds, and did not reach Bengal
      till December.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nabob was revelling in fancied security at Moorshedabad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so profoundly ignorant of the state of foreign countries that he
      often used to say that there were not ten thousand men in all Europe; and
      it had never occurred to him as possible, that the English would dare to
      invade his dominions. But, though undisturbed by any fear of their
      military power, he began to miss them greatly. His revenues fell off; and
      his ministers succeeded in making him understand that a ruler may
      sometimes find it more profitable to protect traders in the open enjoyment
      of their gains than to put them to the torture for the purpose of
      discovering <span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>hidden
      chests of gold and jewels. He was already disposed to permit the Company
      to resume its mercantile operations in his country, when he received the
      news that an English armament was in the Hoogley. He instantly ordered all
      his troops to assemble at Moorshedabad, and marched towards Calcutta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive had commenced operations with his usual vigour. He took Budgebudge,
      routed the garrison of Fort William, recovered Calcutta, stormed and
      sacked Hoogley. The Nabob, already disposed to make some concessions to
      the English, was confirmed in his pacific disposition by these proofs of
      their power and spirit. He accordingly made overtures to the chiefs of the
      invading armament, and offered to restore the factory, and to give
      compensation to those whom he had despoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive&rsquo;s profession was war; and he felt that there was something
      discreditable in an accommodation with Surajah Dowlah. But his power was
      limited. A committee, chiefly composed of servants of the Company who had
      fled from Calcutta, had the principal direction of affairs; and these
      persons were eager to be restored to their posts and compensated for their
      losses. The government of Madras, apprised that war had commenced in
      Europe, and apprehensive of an attack from the French, became impatient
      for the return of the armament. The promises of the Nabob were large, the
      chances of a contest doubtful; and Clive consented to treat, though he
      expressed his regret that things should not be concluded in so glorious a
      manner as he could have wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this negotiation commences a new chapter in the life of Clive.
      Hitherto he had been merely a <span class="pagenum">237</span><a
      name="link237" id="link237"></a>soldier carrying into effect, with eminent
      ability and valour, the plans of others. Henceforth he is to be chiefly
      regarded as a statesman; and his military movements are to be considered
      as subordinate to his political designs. That in his new capacity he
      displayed great ability, and obtained great success, is unquestionable.
      But it is also unquestionable that the transactions in which he now began
      to take a part have left a stain on his moral character.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can by no means agree with Sir John Malcolm, who is obstinately
      resolved to see nothing but honour and integrity in the conduct of his
      hero. But we can as little agree with Mr. Mill, who has gone so far as to
      say that Clive was a man &ldquo;to whom deception, when it suited his purpose,
      never cost a pang.&rdquo; Clive seems to us to have been constitutionally the
      very opposite of a knave, bold even to temerity, sincere even to
      indiscretion, hearty in friendship, open in enmity. Neither in his private
      life, nor in those parts of his public life; in which he had to do with
      his countrymen, do we find any signs of a propensity to cunning. On the
      contrary, in all the disputes in which he was engaged as an Englishman
      against Englishmen, from his boxing-matches at school to those stormy
      altercations at the India House and in Parliament amidst which his later
      years were passed, his very faults were those of a high and magnanimous
      spirit. The truth seems to have been that he considered Oriental politics
      as a game in which nothing was unfair. He knew that the standard of
      morality among the natives of India differed widely from that established
      in England. He knew that he had to deal with men destitute of what in
      Europe is called honour, with men who would give any promise without
      hesitation, and break any promise without <span class="pagenum">238</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a>shame, with men who would unscrupulously
      employ corruption, perjury, forgery, to compass their ends. His letters
      show that the great difference between Asiatic and European morality was
      constantly in his thoughts. He seems to have imagined, most erroneously in
      our opinion, that he could effect nothing against such adversaries, if he
      was content to be bound by ties from which they were free, if he went on
      telling truth, and hearing none, if he fulfilled, to his own hurt, all his
      engagements with confederates who never kept an engagement that was not to
      their advantage. Accordingly this man, in the other parts of his life an
      honourable English gentleman and a soldier, was no sooner matched against
      an Indian intriguer, than he became himself an Indian intriguer, and
      descended, without scruple, to falsehood, to hypocritical caresses, to the
      substitution of documents, and to the counterfeiting of hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negotiations between the English and the Nabob were carried on chiefly
      by two agents, Mr. Watts, a servant of the Company, and a Bengalee of the
      name of Omichund. This Omichund had been one of the wealthiest native
      merchants resident at Calcutta, and had sustained great losses in
      consequence of the Nabob&rsquo;s expedition against that place. In the course of
      his commercial transactions, he had seen much of the English, and was
      peculiarly qualified to serve as a medium of communication between them
      and a native court. He possessed great influence with his own race, and
      had in large measure the Hindoo talents, quick observation, tact,
      dexterity, perseverance, and the Hindoo vices, servility, greediness, and
      treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nabob behaved with all the faithlessness of an Indian statesman, and
      with all the levity of a boy whose <span class="pagenum">239</span><a
      name="link239" id="link239"></a>mind had been enfeebled by power and
      self-indulgence. He promised, retracted, hesitated, evaded. At one time he
      advanced with his army in a threatening manner towards Calcutta; but when
      he saw the resolute front which the English presented, he fell back in
      alarm, and consented to make peace with them on their own terms. The
      treaty was no sooner concluded than he formed new designs against them. He
      intrigued with the French authorities at Chandernagore. He invited Bussy
      to march from the Deccan to the Hoogley, and to drive the English out of
      Bengal. All this was well known to Clive and Watson. They determined
      accordingly to strike a decisive blow, and to attack Chandernagore, before
      the force there could be strengthened by new arrivals, either from the
      south of India, or from Europe. Watson directed the expedition by water,
      Clive by land. The success of the combined movements was rapid and
      complete. The fort, the garrison, the artillery, the military stores, all
      fell into the hands of the English. Near five hundred European troops were
      among the prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nabob had feared and hated the English, even while he was still able
      to oppose to them their French rivals. The French were now vanquished; and
      he began to regard the English with still greater fear and still greater
      hatred. His weak and unprincipled mind oscillated between servility and
      insolence. One day he sent a large sum to Calcutta, as part of the
      compensation due for the wrongs which he had committed. The next day he
      sent a present of jewels to Bussy, exhorting that distinguished officer to
      hasten to protect Bengal &ldquo;against Clive, the daring in war, on whom,&rdquo; says
      his Highness, &ldquo;may all bad fortune attend.&rdquo; He ordered his army to march
      against the English. He countermanded <span class="pagenum">240</span><a
      name="link240" id="link240"></a>his orders. He tore Clive&rsquo;s letters. He
      then sent answers in the most florid language of compliment. He ordered
      Watts out of his presence, and threatened to impale him. He again sent for
      Watts, and begged pardon for the insult. In the mean time, his wretched
      maladministration, his folly, his dissolute manners, and his love of the
      lowest company, had disgusted all classes of his subjects, soldiers,
      traders, civil functionaries, the proud and ostentatious Mahommedans, the
      timid, supple, and parsimonious Hindoos. A formidable confederacy was
      formed against him, in which were included Roydullub, the minister of
      finance, Meer Jaffier, the principal commander of the troops, and Jugget
      Seit, the richest banker in India. The plot was confided to the English
      agents, and a communication was opened between the malcontents at
      Moorshedabad and the committee at Calcutta.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the committee there was much hesitation; but Clive&rsquo;s voice was given in
      favour of the conspirators, and his vigour and firmness bore down all
      opposition. It was determined that the English should lend their powerful
      assistance to depose Surajah Dowlah, and to place Meer Jaffier on the
      throne of Bengal. In return, Meer Jaffier promised ample compensation to
      the Company and its servants, and a liberal donative to the army, the
      navy, and the committee. The odious vices of Surajah Dowlah, the wrongs
      which the English had suffered at his hands, the dangers to which our
      trade must have been exposed, had he continued to reign, appear to us
      fully to justify the resolution of deposing him. But nothing can justify
      the dissimulation which Clive stooped to practise. He wrote to Surajah
      Dowlah in terms so affectionate that they for a time lulled that weak
      prince into perfect security. The same courier <span class="pagenum">241</span><a
      name="link241" id="link241"></a>who carried this &ldquo;soothing letter,&rdquo; as
      Clive calls it, to the Nabob, carried to Mr. Watts a letter in the
      following terms: &ldquo;Tell Meer Jaffier to fear nothing. I will join him with
      five thousand men who never turned their backs. Assure him I will march
      night and day to his assistance, and stand by him as long as I have a man
      left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible that a plot which had so many ramifications should long
      remain entirely concealed. Enough reached the ears of the Nabob to arouse
      his suspicions. But he was soon quieted by the fictions and artifices
      which the inventive genius of Omichund produced with miraculous readiness.
      All was going well; the plot was nearly ripe; when Clive learned that
      Omichund was likely to play false. The artful Bengalee had been promised a
      liberal compensation for all that he had lost at Calcutta. But this would
      not satisfy him. His services had been great. He held the thread of the
      whole intrigue. By one word breathed in the ear of Surajah Dowlah, he
      could undo all that he had done. The lives of Watts, of Meer Jaffier, of
      all the conspirators, were at his mercy; and he determined to take
      advantage of his situation and to make his own terms. He demanded three
      hundred thousand pounds sterling as the price of his secrecy and of his
      assistance. The committee, incensed by the treachery and appalled by the
      danger, knew not what course to take. But Clive was more than Omichund&rsquo;s
      match in Omichund&rsquo;s own arts. The man, he said, was a villain. Any
      artifice which would defeat such knavery was justifiable. The best course
      would be to promise what was asked. Omichund would soon be at their mercy;
      and then they might punish him by withholding from him, not only the bribe
      which he now demanded, but also the <span class="pagenum">242</span><a
      name="link242" id="link242"></a>compensation which all the other sufferers
      of Calcutta were to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      His advice was taken. But how was the wary and sagacious Hindoo to be
      deceived? He had demanded that an article touching his claims should be
      inserted in the treaty between Meer Jaffier and the English, and he would
      not be satisfied unless he saw it with his own eyes. Clive had an
      expedient ready. Two treaties were drawn up, one on white paper, the other
      on red, the former real, the latter fictitious. In the former Omichund&rsquo;s
      name was not mentioned; the latter, which was to be shown to him,
      contained a stipulation in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another difficulty arose. Admiral Watson had scruples about signing
      the red treaty. Omichund&rsquo;s vigilance and acuteness were such that the
      absence of so important a name would probably awaken his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clive was not a man to do any thing by halves. We almost blush to
      write it. He forged Admiral Watson&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was now ready for action. Mr. Watts fled secretly from Moorshedabad.
      Clive put his troops in motion, and wrote to the Nabob in a tone very
      different from that of his previous letters. He set forth all the wrongs
      which the British had suffered, offered to submit the points in dispute to
      the arbitration of Meer Jaffier, and concluded by announcing that, as the
      rains were about to set in, he and his men would do themselves the honour
      of waiting on his Highness for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surajah Dowlah instantly assembled his whole force, and marched to
      encounter the English. It had been agreed that Meer Jaffier should
      separate himself from the Nabob, and carry over his division to Clive.
      But, <span class="pagenum">243</span><a name="link243" id="link243"></a>as
      the decisive moment approached, the fears of the conspirator overpowered
      his ambition. Clive had advanced to Cossimbuzar; the Nabob lay with a
      mighty power a few miles off at Plassey; and still Meer Jaffier delayed to
      fulfil his engagements, and returned evasive answers to the earnest
      remonstrances of the English general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive was in a painfully anxious situation. He could place no confidence
      in the sincerity or in the courage of his confederate: and whatever
      confidence he might place in his own military talents, and in the valour
      and discipline of his troops, it was no light thing to engage an army
      twenty times as numerous as his own. Before him lay a river over which it
      was easy to advance, but over which, if things went ill, not one of his
      little hand would ever return. On this occasion, for the first and for the
      last time, his dauntless spirit, during a few hours, shrank from the
      fearful responsibility of making a decision. He called a council of war.
      The majority pronounced against fighting; and Clive declared his
      concurrence with the majority. Long afterwards, he said that he had never
      called but one council of war, and that, if he had taken the advice of
      that council, the British would never have been masters of Bengal. But
      scarcely had the meeting broke up when he was himself again. He retired
      alone under the shade of some trees, and passed near an hour there in
      thought. He came back determined to put every thing to the hazard, and
      gave orders that all should be in readiness for passing the river on the
      morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river was passed; and, at the close of a toilsome day&rsquo;s march, the
      army, long after sunset, took up its quarters in a grove of mango trees
      near Plassey, within a mile of the enemy. Clive was unable to <span
      class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244" id="link244"></a>sleep; he
      heard, through the whole night, the sound of drums and cymbals from the
      vast camp of the Nabob. It is not strange that even his stout heart should
      now and then have sunk, when he reflected against what odds, and for what
      a prize, he was in a few hours to contend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the rest of Surajah Dowlah more peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind, at once weak and stormy, was distracted by wild and horrible
      apprehensions. Appalled by the greatness and nearness of the crisis,
      distrusting his captains, dreading every one who approached him, dreading
      to be left alone, he sat gloomily in his tent, haunted, a Greek poet would
      have said, by the furies of those who had cursed him with their last
      breath in the Black Hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day broke, the day which was to decide the fate of India. At sunrise,
      the army of the Nabob, pouring through many openings of the camp, began to
      move towards the grove where the English lay. Forty thousand infantry,
      armed with firelocks, pikes, swords, bows and arrows, covered the plain.
      They were accompanied by fifty pieces of ordnance of the largest size,
      each tugged by a long team of white oxen, and each pushed on from behind
      by an elephant. Some smaller guns, under the direction of a few French
      auxiliaries, were perhaps more formidable. The cavalry were fifteen
      thousand, drawn, not from the effeminate population of Bengal, but from
      the bolder race which inhabits the northern provinces; and the practised
      eye of Clive could perceive that both the men and the horses were more
      powerful than those of the Carnatic. The force which he had to oppose to
      this great multitude consisted of only three thousand men. But of these
      nearly a thousand were English; and all were led by English officers, and
      <span class="pagenum">245</span><a name="link245" id="link245"></a>trained
      in the English discipline. Conspicuous in the ranks of the little army
      were the men of the Thirty-Ninth Regiment, which still bears on its
      colours, amidst many honourable additions won under Wellington in Spain
      and Gascony, the name of Plassey, and the proud motto, <i>Primus in Indis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle commenced with a cannonade in which the artillery of the Nabob
      did scarcely any execution, while the few field-pieces of the English
      produced great effect. Several of the most distinguished officers in
      Surajah Dowlah&rsquo;s service fell. Disorder began to spread through his ranks.
      His own terror increased every moment. One of the conspirators urged on
      him the expediency of retreating. The insidious advice, agreeing as it did
      with what his own terrors suggested, was readily received. He ordered his
      army to fall back, and this order decided his fate. Clive snatched the
      moment, and ordered his troops to advance. The confused and dispirited
      multitude gave way before the onset of disciplined valour. No mob attacked
      by regular soldiers was ever more completely routed. The little band of
      Frenchmen, who alone ventured to confront the English, were swept down the
      stream of fugitives. In an hour the forces of Surajah Dowlah were
      dispersed, never to reassemble. Only five hundred of the vanquished were
      slain. But their camp, their guns, their baggage, innumerable waggons,
      innumerable cattle, remained in the power of the conquerors. With the loss
      of twenty-two soldiers killed and fifty wounded, Clive had scattered an
      army of near sixty thousand men, and subdued an empire larger and more
      populous than Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meer Jaffier had given no assistance to the English during the action. But
      as soon as he saw that the <span class="pagenum">246</span><a
      name="link246" id="link246"></a>fate of the day was decided, he drew off
      his division of the army, and, when the battle was over, sent his
      congratulations to his ally. The next morning he repaired to the English
      quarters, not a little uneasy as to the reception which awaited him there.
      He gave evident signs of alarm when a guard was drawn out to receive him
      with the honours due to his rank. But his apprehensions were speedily
      removed. Clive came forward to meet him, embraced him, saluted him as
      Nabob of the three great provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, listened
      graciously to his apologies, and advised him to march without delay to
      Moorshedabad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surajah Dowlah had fled from the field of battle with all the speed with
      which a fleet camel could carry him, and arrived at Moorshedabad in little
      more than twenty-four hours. There he called his councillors round him.
      The wisest advised him to put himself into the hands of the English, from
      whom he had nothing worse to fear than deposition and confinement. But he
      attributed this suggestion to treachery. Others urged him to try the
      chance of war again. He approved the advice, and issued orders
      accordingly. But he wanted spirit to adhere even during one day to a manly
      resolution. He learned that Meer Jaffier had arrived; and his terrors
      became insupportable. Disguised in a mean dress, with a casket of jewels
      in his hand, he let himself down at night from a window of his palace,
      and, accompanied by only two attendants, embarked on the river for Patna.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days Clive arrived at Moorshedabad, escorted by two hundred
      English soldiers and three hundred sepoys. For his residence had been
      assigned a <span class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>palace,
      which was surrounded by a garden so spacious that all the troops who
      accompanied him could conveniently encamp within it. The ceremony of the
      installation of Meer Jaffier was instantly performed. Clive led the new
      Nabob to the seat of honour, placed him on it, presented to him, after the
      immemorial fashion of the East, an offering of gold, and then, turning to
      the natives who filled the hall, congratulated them on the good fortune
      which had freed them from a tyrant. He was compelled on this occasion to
      use the services of an interpreter; for it is remarkable that, long as he
      resided in India, intimately acquainted as he was with Indian politics and
      with the Indian character, and adored as he was by his Indian soldiery, he
      never learned to express himself with facility in any Indian language. He
      is said indeed to have been sometimes under the necessity of employing, in
      his intercourse with natives of India, the smattering of Portuguese which
      he had acquired when a lad, in Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new sovereign was now called upon to fulfil the engagements into which
      he had entered with his allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conference was held at the house of Jugget Seit, the great banker, for
      the purpose of making the necessary arrangements. Omichund came thither,
      fully believing himself to stand high in the favour of Clive, who, with
      dissimulation surpassing even the dissimulation of Bengal, had up to that
      day treated him with undiminished kindness. The white treaty was produced
      and read. Clive then turned to Mr. Scrafton, one of the servants of the
      Company, and said in English, &ldquo;It is now time to undeceive Omichund.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Omichund,&rdquo; said Mr. Scrafton in Hindostanee, &ldquo;the red treaty is a trick
      you are to have nothing.&rdquo; Omichund fell back in <span class="pagenum">248</span><a
      name="link248" id="link248"></a>to the arms of his attendants. He revived;
      but his mind was irreparably ruined. Clive, who, though little troubled by
      scruples of conscience in his dealings with Indian politicians, was not
      inhuman, seems to have been touched. He saw Omichund a few days later,
      spoke to him kindly, advised him to make a pilgrimage to one of the great
      temples of India, in the hope that change of scene might restore his
      health, and was even disposed, notwithstanding all that had passed, again
      to employ him in the public service. But from the moment of that sudden
      shock, the unhappy man sank gradually into idiocy. He who had formerly
      been distinguished for the strength of his understanding and the
      simplicity of his habits, now squandered the remains of his fortune on
      childish trinkets, and loved to exhibit himself dressed in rich garments,
      and hung with precious stones. In this abject state he languished a few
      months, and then died.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should not think it necessary to offer any remarks for the purpose of
      directing the judgment of our readers, with respect to this transaction,
      had not Sir John Malcolm undertaken to defend it in all its parts. He
      regrets, indeed, that it was necessary to employ means so liable to abuse
      as forgery; but he will not admit that any blame attaches to those who
      deceived the deceiver. He thinks that the English were not bound to keep
      faith with one who kept no faith with them, and that, if they had
      fulfilled their engagements with the wily Bengalee, so signal an example
      of successful treason would have produced a crowd of imitators. Now, we
      will not discuss this point on any rigid principles of morality. Indeed,
      it is quite unnecessary to do so for, looking at the question as a
      question of expediency in the lowest sense of the word, and using no
      arguments <span class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>but
      such as Machiavelli might have employed in his conferences with Borgia, we
      are convinced that Clive was altogether in the wrong, and that he
      committed, not merely a crime, but a blunder. That honesty is the best
      policy is a maxim which we firmly believe to be generally correct, even
      with respect to the temporal interests of individuals; but with respect to
      societies, the rule is subject to still fewer exceptions, and that for
      this reason, that the life of societies is longer than the life of
      individuals. It is possible to mention men who have owed great worldly
      prosperity to breaches of private faith; but we doubt whether it be
      possible to mention a state which has on the whole been a gainer by a
      breach of public faith. The entire history of British India is an
      illustration of the great truth, that it is not prudent to oppose perfidy
      to perfidy, and that the most efficient weapon with which men can
      encounter falsehood is truth. During a long course of years, the English
      rulers of India, surrounded by allies and enemies whom no engagement could
      bind, have generally acted with sincerity and uprightness; and the event
      has proved that sincerity and uprightness are wisdom. English valour and
      English intelligence have done less to extend and to preserve our Oriental
      empire than English veracity. All that we could have gained by imitating
      the doublings, the evasions, the fictions, the perjuries which have been
      employed against us is as nothing, when compared with what we have gained
      by being the one power in India on whose word reliance can be placed. No
      oath which superstition can devise, no hostage however precious, inspires
      a hundredth part of the confidence which is produced by the &ldquo;yea, yea,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;nay, nay,&rdquo; of a British envoy. No fastness, however strong by art or
      nature, gives to <span class="pagenum">250</span><a name="link250"
       id="link250"></a>its inmates a security like that enjoyed by the chief
      who, passing through the territories of powerful and deadly enemies, is
      armed with the British guarantee. The mightiest princes of the East can
      scarcely, by the offer of enormous usury, draw forth any portion of the
      wealth which is concealed under the hearths of their subjects. The British
      Government offers little more than four per cent.; and avarice hastens to
      bring forth tens of millions of rupees from its most secret repositories.
      A hostile monarch may promise mountains of gold to our sepoys, on
      condition that they will desert the standard of the Company. The Company
      promises only a moderate pension after a long service. But every sepoy
      knows that the promise of the Company will be kept: he knows that if he
      lives a hundred years his rice and salt are as secure as the salary of the
      Governor-General: and he knows that there is not another state in India
      which would not, in spite of the most solemn vows, leave him to die of
      hunger in a ditch as soon as he had ceased to be useful. The greatest
      advantage which a government can possess is to be the one trustworthy
      government in the midst of governments which nobody can trust. This
      advantage we enjoy in Asia. Had we acted during the last two generations
      on the principles which Sir John Malcolm appears to have considered as
      sound, had we as often as we had to deal with people like Omichund,
      retaliated by lying and forging, and breaking faith, after their fashion,
      it is our firm belief that no courage or capacity could have upheld our
      empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Malcolm admits that Clive&rsquo;s breach of faith could be justified
      only by the strongest necessity. As we think that breach of faith not only
      unnecessary, but most inexpedient, we need hardly say that we altogether
      condemn it. <span class="pagenum">251</span><a name="link251" id="link251"></a>Omichund
      was not the only victim of the revolution. Surajah Dowlah was taken a few
      days after his flight, and was brought before Meer Jaffier. There he flung
      himself on the ground in convulsions of fear, and with tears and loud
      cries implored the mercy which he had never shown. Meer Jaffier hesitated;
      but his son Meeran, a youth of seventeen, who in feebleness of brain and
      savageness of nature greatly resembled the wretched captive, was
      implacable. Surajah Dowlah was led into a secret chamber, to which in a
      short time the ministers of death were sent. In this act the English bore
      no part; and Meer Jaffier understood so much of their feelings, that he
      thought it necessary to apologize to them for having avenged them on their
      most malignant enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shower of wealth now fell copiously on the Company and its servants. A
      sum of eight hundred thousand pounds sterling, in coined silver, was sent
      down the river from Moorshedabad to Fort William. The fleet which conveyed
      this treasure consisted of more than a hundred boats, and performed its
      triumphal voyage with flags flying and music playing. Calcutta, which a
      few months before had been desolate, was now more prosperous than ever.
      Trade revived; and the signs of affluence appeared in every English house.
      As to Clive, there was no limit to his acquisitions but his own
      moderation. The treasury of Bengal was thrown open to him. There were
      piled up, after the usage of Indian princes, immense masses of coin, among
      which might not seldom be detected the florins and byzants with which,
      before any European ship had turned the Cape of Good Hope, the Venetians
      purchased the stuffs and spices of the East. Clive walked between heaps of
      gold and silver, crowned with rubies <span class="pagenum">252</span><a
      name="link252" id="link252"></a>and diamonds, and was at liberty to help
      himself. He accepted between two and three hundred thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pecuniary transactions between Meer Jaffier and Clive were sixteen
      years later condemned by the public voice, and severely criticised in
      Parliament. They are vehemently defended by Sir John Malcolm. The accusers
      of the victorious general represented his gains as the wages of
      corruption, or as plunder extorted at the point of the sword from a
      helpless ally. The biographer, on the other hand, considers these great
      acquisitions as free gifts, honourable alike to the donor and to the
      receiver, and compares them to the rewards bestowed by foreign powers on
      Marlborough, on Nelson, and on Wellington. It had always, he says, been
      customary in the East to give and receive presents; and there was, as yet,
      no Act of Parliament positively prohibiting English functionaries in India
      from profiting by this Asiatic usage. This reasoning, we own, does not
      quite satisfy us. We do not suspect Clive of selling the interests of his
      employers or his country; but we cannot acquit him of having done what, if
      not in itself evil, was yet of evil example. Nothing is more clear than
      that a general ought to be the servant of his own government, and of no
      other. It follows that whatever rewards he receives for his services ought
      to be given either by his own government, or with the full knowledge and
      approbation of his own government. This rule ought to be strictly
      maintained even with respect to the merest bauble, with respect to a
      cross, a medal, or a yard of coloured riband. But how can any government
      be well served, if those who command its forces are at liberty, without
      its permission, without its privity, to accept princely fortunes from its
      allies? It is <span class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253"
       id="link253"></a>idle to say that there was then no Act of Parliament
      prohibiting the practice of taking presents from Asiatic sovereigns. It is
      not on the Act which was passed at a later period for the purpose of
      preventing any such taking of presents, but on grounds which were valid
      before that Act was passed, on grounds of common law and common sense,
      that we arraign the conduct of Clive. There is no Act that we know of,
      prohibiting the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from being in the
      pay of continental powers, but it is not the less true that a Secretary
      who should receive a secret pension from France would grossly violate his
      duty, and would deserve severe punishment. Sir John Malcolm compares the
      conduct of Clive with that of the Duke of Wellington. Suppose,&mdash;and
      we beg pardon for putting such a supposition even for the sake of
      argument,&mdash;that the Duke of Wellington had, after the campaign of
      1815, and while he commanded the army of occupation in France, privately
      accepted two hundred thousand pounds from Lewis the Eighteenth, as a mark
      of gratitude for the great services which his Grace had rendered to the
      House of Bourbon; what would be thought of such a transaction? Yet the
      statute-book no more forbids the taking of presents in Europe now than it
      forbade the taking of presents in Asia then.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, it must be admitted that, in Clive&rsquo;s case, there were
      many extenuating circumstances. He considered himself as the general, not
      of the Crown, but of the Company. The Company had, by implication at
      least, authorised its agents to enrich themselves by means of the
      liberality of the native princes, and by other means still more
      objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly to be expected that the servant should entertain stricter
      notions of his duty than were entertained <span class="pagenum">254</span><a
      name="link254" id="link254"></a>by his masters. Though Clive did not
      distinctly acquaint his employers with what had taken place and request
      their sanction, he did not, on the other hand, by studied concealment,
      show that he was conscious of having done wrong. On the contrary, he
      avowed with the greatest openness that the Nabob&rsquo;s bounty had raised him
      to affluence. Lastly, though we think that he ought not in such a way to
      have taken any thing, we must admit that he deserves praise for having
      taken so little. He accepted twenty lacs of rupees. It would have cost him
      only a word to make the twenty forty. It was a very easy exercise of
      virtue to declaim in England against Clive&rsquo;s rapacity; but not one in a
      hundred of his accusers would have shown so much self-command in the
      treasury of Moorshedabad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meer Jaffier could be upheld on the throne only by the hand which had
      placed him on it. He was not, indeed, a mere boy; nor had he been so
      fortunate as to be born in the purple. He was not therefore quite so
      imbecile or quite so depraved as his predecessor had been. But he had none
      of the talents or virtues which his post required; and his son and heir,
      Meeran, was another Surajah Dowlah. The recent revolution had unsettled
      the minds of men. Many chiefs were in open insurrection against the new
      Nabob. The viceroy of the rich and powerful province of Oude, who, like
      the other viceroys of the Mogul, was now in truth an independent
      sovereign, menaced Bengal with invasion. Nothing but the talents and
      authority of Clive could support the tottering government. While things
      were in this state a ship arrived with despatches which had been written
      at the India House before the news of the battle of Plassey had reached
      London. The Directors had determined to place the English settlements in
      Ben gal <span class="pagenum">255</span><a name="link255" id="link255"></a>under
      a government constituted in the most cumbrous and absurd manner; and, to
      make the matter worse, no place in the arrangement was assigned to Clive.
      The persons who were selected to form this new government, greatly to
      their honour, took on themselves the responsibility of disobeying these
      preposterous orders, and invited Clive to exercise the supreme authority.
      He consented; and it soon appeared that the servants of the Company had
      only anticipated the wishes of their employers. The Directors, on
      receiving news of Clive&rsquo;s brilliant success, instantly appointed him
      governor of their possessions in Bengal, with the highest marks of
      gratitude and esteem. His power was now boundless, and far surpassed even
      that which Dupleix had attained in the south of India. Meer Jaffier
      regarded him with slavish awe. On one occasion, the Nabob spoke with
      severity to a native chief of high rank, whose followers had been engaged
      in a brawl with some of the Company&rsquo;s sepoys. &ldquo;Are you yet to learn,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;who that Colonel Clive is, and in what station God has placed him?&rdquo;
       The chief, who, as a famous jester and an old friend of Meer Jaffier,
      could venture to take liberties, answered, &ldquo;I affront the Colonel! I, who
      never get up in the morning without making three low bows to his jackass!&rdquo;
       This was hardly an exaggeration. Europeans and natives were alike at
      Clive&rsquo;s feet. The English regarded him as the only man who could force
      Meer Jaffier to keep his engagements with them. Meer Jaffier regarded him
      as the only man who could protect the new dynasty against turbulent
      subjects and encroaching neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but justice to say that Clive used his power ably and vigorously for
      the advantage of his country. He sent forth an expedition against the
      tract lying to the <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256"
       id="link256"></a>north of the Carnatic. In this tract the French still had
      the ascendency; and it was important to dislodge them. The conduct of the
      enterprise was intrusted to an officer of the name of Forde, who was then
      little known, but in whom the keen eye of the governor had detected
      military talents of a high order. The success of the expedition was rapid
      and splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a considerable part of the army of Bengal was thus engaged at a
      distance, a new and formidable danger menaced the western frontier. The
      Great Mogul was a prisoner at Delhi in the hands of a subject. His eldest
      son, named Shah Alum, destined to be, during many years, the sport of
      adverse fortune, and to be a tool in the hands, first of the Mahrattas,
      and then of the English, had fled from the palace of his father. His birth
      was still revered in India. Some powerful princes, the Nabob of Oude in
      particular, were inclined to favour him. Shah Alum found it easy to draw
      to his standard great numbers of the military adventurers with whom every
      part of the country swarmed. An army of forty thousand men, of various
      races and religions, Mahrattas, Rohillas, Jauts, and Afghans, was speedily
      assembled round him; and he formed the design of overthrowing the upstart
      whom the English had elevated to a throne, and of establishing his own
      authority throughout Bengal, Orissa, and Bahar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meer Jaffier&rsquo;s terror was extreme; and the only expedient which occurred
      to him was to purchase, by the payment of a large sum of money, an
      accommodation with Shah Alum. This expedient had been repeatedly employed
      by those who, before him, had ruled the rich and unwarlike provinces near
      the mouth of the Ganges. But Clive treated the suggestion with a scorn
      worthy of his strong sense and dauntless courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <span class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257" id="link257"></a>you
      do this,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;you will have the Nabob of Oude, the Mahrattas, and
      many more, come from all parts of the confines of your country, who will
      bully you out of money till you have none left in your treasury. I beg
      your Excellency will rely on the fidelity of the English, and of those
      troops which are attached to you.&rdquo; He wrote in a similar strain to the
      governor of Patna, a brave native soldier whom he highly esteemed. &ldquo;Come
      to no terms; defend your city to the last. Rest assured that the English
      are stanch and firm friends, and that they never desert a cause in which
      they have once taken a part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept his word. Shah Alum had invested Patna, and was on the point of
      proceeding to storm, when he learned that the Colonel was advancing by
      forced marches. The whole army which was approaching consisted only of
      four hundred and fifty Europeans and two thousand five hundred sepoys. But
      Clive and his Englishmen were now objects of dread over all the East. As
      soon as his advanced guard appeared, the besiegers fled before him. A few
      French adventurers who were about the person of the prince advised him to
      try the chance of battle; but in vain. In a few days this great army,
      which had been regarded with so much uneasiness by the court of
      Moorshedabad, melted away before the mere terror of the British name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conqueror returned in triumph to Fort William. The joy of Meer Jaffier
      was as unbounded as his fears had been, and led him to bestow on his
      preserver a princely token of gratitude. The quit-rent which the East
      India Company were bound to pay to the Nabob for the extensive lands held
      by them to the south of Calcutta amounted to near thirty thousand pounds
      sterling a year. The whole of this splendid estate, <span class="pagenum">258</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>sufficient to support with dignity the
      highest rank of the British peerage, was now conferred on Clive for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This present we think Clive was justified in accepting. It was a present
      which, from its very nature, could be no secret. In fact, the Company
      itself was his tenant, and, by its acquiescence, signified its approbation
      of Meer Jaffier&rsquo;s grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gratitude of Meer Jaffier did not last long. He had for some time
      felt that the powerful ally who had set him up might pull him down, and
      had been looking round for support against the formidable strength by
      which he had himself been hitherto supported. He knew that it would be
      impossible to find among the natives of India any force which would look
      the Colonel&rsquo;s little army in the face. The French power in Bengal was
      extinct. But the fame of the Dutch had anciently been great in the Eastern
      seas; and it was not yet distinctly known in Asia how much the power of
      Holland had declined in Europe. Secret communications passed between the
      court of Moorshedabad and the Dutch factory at Chinsurah; and urgent
      letters were sent from Chinsurah, exhorting the government of Batavia to
      fit out an expedition which might balance the power of the English in
      Bengal. The authorities of Batavia, eager to extend the influence of their
      country, and still more eager to obtain for themselves a share of the
      wealth which had recently raised so many English adventurers to opulence,
      equipped a powerful armament. Seven large ships from Java arrived
      unexpectedly in the Hoogley. The military force on board amounted to
      fifteen hundred men, of whom about one half were Europeans. The enterprise
      was well timed. Clive had sent such large detachments to <span
      class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259" id="link259"></a>oppose the
      French in the Carnatic that his army was now inferior in number to that of
      the Dutch. He knew that Meer Jaffier secretly favoured the invaders. He
      knew that he took on himself a serious responsibility if he attacked the
      forces of a friendly power; that the English ministers could not wish to
      see a war with Holland added to that in which they were already engaged
      with France; that they might disavow his acts; that they might punish him.
      He had recently remitted a great part of his fortune to Europe, through
      the Dutch East India Company; and he had therefore a strong interest in
      avoiding any quarrel. But he was satisfied that, if he suffered the
      Batavian armament to pass up the river and to join the garrison of
      Chinsurah, Meer Jaffier would throw himself into the arms of these new
      allies, and that the English ascendency in Bengal would be exposed to most
      serious danger. He took his resolution with characteristic boldness, and
      was most ably seconded by his officers, particularly by Colonel Forde, to
      whom the most important part of the operations was intrusted. The Dutch
      attempted to force a passage. The English encountered them both by land
      and water. On both elements the enemy had a great superiority of force. On
      both they were signally defeated. Their ships were taken. Their troops
      were put to a total rout. Almost all the European soldiers, who
      constituted the main strength of the invading army, were killed or taken.
      The conquerors sat down before Chinsurah; and the chiefs of that
      settlement, now thoroughly humbled, consented to the terms which Clive
      dictated. They engaged to build no fortifications, and to raise no troops
      beyond a small force necessary for the police of their factories; and it
      was distinctly provided that, any violation of these covenants <span
      class="pagenum">260</span><a name="link260" id="link260"></a>should be
      punished with instant expulsion from Bengal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months after this great victory, Clive sailed for. England. At home,
      honours and rewards awaited him, not indeed equal to his claims or to his
      ambition, but still such as, when his age, his rank in the army, and his
      original place in society are considered, must be pronounced rare and
      splendid. He was raised to the Irish peerage, and encouraged to expect an
      English title. George the Third, who had just ascended the throne,
      received him with great distinction. The ministers paid him marked
      attention; and Pitt, whose influence in the House of Commons and in the
      country was unbounded, was eager to mark his regard for one whose exploits
      had contributed so much to the lustre of that memorable period. The great
      orator had already in Parliament described Clive as a heaven-born general,
      as a man who, bred to the labour of the desk, had displayed a military
      genius which might excite the admiration of the King of Prussia. There
      were then no reporters in the gallery; but these words, emphatically
      spoken by the first statesman of the age, had passed from mouth to mouth,
      had been transmitted to Clive in Bengal, and had greatly delighted and
      flattered him. Indeed, since the death of Wolfe, Clive was the only
      English general of whom his countrymen had much reason to be proud. The
      Duke of Cumberland had been generally unfortunate; and his single victory,
      having been gained over his countrymen and used with merciless severity,
      had been more fatal to his popularity than his many defeats. Conway,
      versed in the learning of his profession, and personally courageous,
      wanted vigour and capacity. Granby, honest, generous, and as brave as a
      lion, had neither <span class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261"
       id="link261"></a>science nor genius. Sackville, inferior in knowledge and
      abilities to none of his contemporaries, bad incurred, unjustly as we
      believe, the imputation most fatal to the character of a soldier. It was
      under the command of a foreign general that the British had triumphed at
      Minden and Warburg. The people therefore, as was natural, greeted with
      pride and delight a captain of their own, whose native courage and
      self-taught skill had placed him on a level with the great tacticians of
      Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wealth of Clive was such as enabled him to vie with the first grandees
      of England. There remains proof that he had remitted more than a hundred
      and eighty thousand pounds through the Dutch East India Company, and more
      than forty thousand pounds through the English Company. The amount which
      he had sent home through private houses was also considerable. He had
      invested great sums in jewels, then a very common mode of remittance from
      India. His purchases of diamonds at Madras alone, amounted to twenty-five
      thousand pounds. Besides a great mass of ready money, he had his Indian
      estate, valued by himself at twenty-seven thousand a year. His whole
      annual income, in the opinion of Sir John Malcolm, who is desirous to
      state it as low as possible, exceeded forty thousand pounds; and incomes
      of forty thousand pounds at the time of the accession of George the Third
      were at least as rare as incomes of a hundred thousand pounds now. We may
      safely affirm that no Englishman who started with nothing, has ever, in
      any line of life, created such a fortune at the early age of thirty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unjust not to add that Clive made a creditable use of his
      riches. As soon as the battle of <span class="pagenum">262</span><a
      name="link262" id="link262"></a>Plassey had laid the foundation of his
      fortune, he sent ten thousand pounds to his sisters, bestowed as much more
      on other poor friends and relations, ordered his agent to pay eight
      hundred a year to his parents, and to insist that they should keep a
      carriage, and settled five hundred a year on his old commander Lawrence,
      whose means were very slender. The whole sum which Clive expended in this
      manner may be calculated at fifty thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now set himself to cultivate Parliamentary interest. His purchases of
      land seem to have been made in a great measure with that view, and, after
      the general election of 1761, he found himself in the House of Commons, at
      the head of a body of dependents whose support must have been important to
      any administration. In English politics, however, he did not take a
      prominent part. His first attachments, as we have seen, were to Mr. Fox;
      at a later period he was attracted by the genius and success of Mr. Pitt;
      but finally he connected himself in the closest manner with George
      Grenville. Early in the session of 1764, when the illegal and impolitic
      persecution of that worthless demagogue Wilkes had strongly excited the
      public mind, the town was amused by an anecdote, which we have seen in
      some unpublished memoirs of Horace Walpole. Old Mr. Richard Clive, who,
      since his son&rsquo;s elevation, had been introduced into society for which his
      former habits had not well fitted him, presented himself at the levee. The
      King asked him where Lord Clive was. &ldquo;He will be in town very soon,&rdquo; said
      the old gentleman, loud enough to be heard by the whole circle, &ldquo;and then
      your Majesty will have another vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in truth all Clive&rsquo;s views were directed towards <span class="pagenum">263</span><a
      name="link263" id="link263"></a>the country in which he had so eminently
      distinguished himself as a soldier and a statesman; and it was by
      considerations relating to India that his conduct as a public man in
      England was regulated. The power of the Company, though an anomaly, is in
      our time, we are firmly persuaded, a beneficial anomaly. In the time of
      Clive, it was not merely an anomaly, but a nuisance. There was no Board of
      Control. The Director were for the most part mere traders, ignorant of
      general politics, ignorant of the peculiarities of the empire which had
      strangely become subject to them. The Court of Proprietors, wherever it
      chose to interfere, was able to have its way. That court was more
      numerous, as well as more powerful, than at present; for then every share
      of five hundred pounds conferred a vote. The meetings were large, stormy,
      even riotous, the debates indecently virulent. All the turbulence of a
      Westminster election, all the trickery and corruption of a Grampound
      election, disgraced the proceedings of this assembly on questions of the
      most solemn importance. Fictitious votes were manufactured on a gigantic
      scale. Clive himself laid out a hundred thousand pounds in the purchase of
      stock, which he then divided among nominal proprietors on whom he could
      depend, and whom he brought down in his train to every discussion and
      every ballot. Others did the same, though not to quite so enormous an
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest taken by the public of England in Indian questions was then
      far greater than at present, and the reason is obvious. At present a
      writer enters the service young; he climbs slowly; he is fortunate if, at
      forty-five, he can return to his country with an annuity of a thousand a
      year, and with savings amounting to thirty thousand pounds. A great
      quantity of wealth is made <span class="pagenum">264</span><a
      name="link264" id="link264"></a>by English functionaries in India; but no
      single functionary makes a very large fortune, and what is made is slowly,
      hardly, and honestly earned. Only four or five high political offices are
      reserved for public men from England. The residencies, the secretaryships,
      the seats in the boards of revenue and in the Sudder courts are all filled
      by men who have given the best years of life to the service of the
      Company; nor can any talents however splendid or any connections however
      powerful obtain those lucrative posts for any person who has not entered
      by the regular door, and mounted by the regular gradations. Seventy years
      ago, less money was brought home from the East than in our time. But it
      was divided among a very much smaller number of persons, and immense sums
      were often accumulated in a few months. Any Englishman, whatever his age
      might be, might hope to be one of the lucky emigrants. If he made a good
      speech in Leadenhall Street, or published a clever pamphlet in defence of
      the chairman, he might be sent out in the Company&rsquo;s service, and might
      return in three or four years as rich as Pigot or as Clive. Thus the India
      House was a lottery-office, which invited everybody to take a chance, and
      held out ducal fortunes as the prizes destined for the lucky few. As soon
      as it was known that there was a part of the world where a
      lieutenant-colonel had one morning received as a present an estate as
      large as that of the Earl of Bath or the Marquess of Rockingham, and where
      it seemed that such a trifle as ten or twenty thousand pounds was to be
      had by any British functionary for the asking, society began to exhibit
      all the symptoms of the South Sea year, a feverish excitement, an
      ungovernable impatience to be rich, a contempt for slow, sure, and
      moderate gains. <span class="pagenum">265</span><a name="link265"
       id="link265"></a>At the head of the preponderating party in the India
      House, had long stood a powerful, able, and ambitious director of the name
      of Sulivan. He had conceived a strong jealousy of Clive, and remembered
      with bitterness the audacity with which the late governor of Bengal had
      repeatedly set at nought the authority of the distant Directors of the
      Company. An apparent reconciliation took place after Clive&rsquo;s arrival; but
      enmity remained deeply rooted in the hearts of both. The whole body of
      Directors was then chosen annually. At the election of 1763, Clive
      attempted to break down the power of the dominant faction. The contest was
      carried on with a violence which he describes as tremendous. Sulivan was
      victorious, and hastened to take his revenge. The grant of rent which
      Clive had received from Meer Jaffier was, in the opinion of the best
      English lawyers, valid. It had been made by exactly the same authority
      from which the Company had received their chief possessions in Bengal, and
      the Company had long acquiesced in it. The Directors, however, most
      unjustly determined to confiscate it, and Clive was forced to file a bill
      in Chancery against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a great and sudden turn in affairs was at hand. Every ship from Bengal
      had for some time brought alarming tidings. The internal misgovernment of
      the province had reached such a point that it could go no further. What,
      indeed, was to be expected from a body of public servants exposed to
      temptation such that, as Clive once said, flesh and blood could not bear
      it, armed with irresistible power, and responsible only to the corrupt,
      turbulent, distracted, ill informed Company, situated at such a distance
      that the average interval between the sending of a dispatch and the
      receipt <span class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>of
      an answer was above a year and a half? Accordingly, during the five years
      which followed the departure of Clive from Bengal, the misgovernment of
      the English was carried to a point such as seems hardly compatible with
      the very existence of society. The Roman proconsul, who, in a year or two,
      squeezed out of a province the means of rearing marble palaces and baths
      on the shores of Campania, of drinking from amber, of feasting on singing
      birds, of exhibiting armies of gladiators and flocks of camelopards; the
      Spanish viceroy, who, leaving behind him the curses of Mexico or Lima,
      entered Madrid with a long train of gilded coaches, and of sumpter-horses
      trapped and shod with silver, were now outdone. Cruelty, indeed, properly
      so called, was not among the vices of the servants of the Company. But
      cruelty itself could hardly have produced greater evils than sprang from
      their unprincipled eagerness to be rich. They pulled down their creature,
      Meer Jaffier. They set up in his place another Nabob, named Meer Cossim.
      But Meer Cossim had parts and a will; and, though sufficiently inclined to
      oppress his subjects himself, he could not bear to see them ground to the
      dust by oppressions which yielded him no profit, nay, which destroyed his
      revenue in the very source. The English accordingly pulled down Meer
      Cossim, and set up Meer Jaffier again; and Meer Cossim, after revenging
      himself by a massacre surpassing in atrocity that of the Black Hole, fled
      to the dominions of the Nabob of Oude. At every one of these revolutions,
      the new prince divided among his foreign masters whatever could be scraped
      together in the treasury of his fallen predecessor. The immense population
      of his dominions was given up as a prey to those who had made him a
      sovereign, and who could unmake him. The servants <span class="pagenum">267</span><a
      name="link267" id="link267"></a>of the Company obtained, not for their
      employers, but for themselves, a monopoly of almost the whole internal
      trade. They forced the natives to buy dear and to sell cheap. They
      insulted with impunity the tribunals, the police, and the fiscal
      authorities of the country. They covered with their protection a set of
      native dependents who ranged through the provinces, spreading desolation
      and terror wherever they appeared. Every servant of a British factor was
      armed with all the power of his master; and his master was armed with all
      the power of the Company. Enormous fortunes were thus rapidly accumulated
      at Calcutta, while thirty millions of human beings were reduced to the
      extremity of wretchedness. They had been accustomed to live under tyranny,
      but never under tyranny like this. They found the little finger of the
      Company thicker than the loins of Surajah Dowlali. Under their old masters
      they had at least one resource: when the evil became insupportable, the
      people rose and pulled down the government. But the English government was
      not to be so shaken off. That government, oppressive as the most
      oppressive form of barbarian despotism, was strong with all the strength
      of civilisation. It resembled the government of evil Genii, rather than
      the government of human tyrants. Even despair could not inspire the soft
      Bengalee with courage to confront men of English breed, the hereditary
      nobility of mankind, whose skill and valour had so often triumphed in
      spite of tenfold odds. The unhappy race never attempted resistance.
      Sometimes they submitted in patient misery. Sometimes they fled from the
      white man, as their fathers had been used to fly from the Mahratta; and
      the palanquin of the English traveller was often carried through silent
      villages and <span class="pagenum">268</span><a name="link268" id="link268"></a>towns,
      which the report of his approach had made desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreign lords of Bengal were naturally objects of hatred to all the
      neighbouring powers; and to all the haughty race presented a dauntless
      front. The English armies, everywhere outnumbered, were everywhere
      victorious. A succession of commanders, formed in the school of Clive,
      still maintained the fame of their country. &ldquo;It must be acknowledged,&rdquo;
       says the Mussulman historian of those times, &ldquo;that this nation&rsquo;s presence
      of mind, firmness of temper, and undaunted bravery, are past all question.
      They join the most resolute courage to the most cautious prudence; nor
      have they their equals in the art of ranging themselves in battle array
      and fighting in order. If to so many military qualifications they knew how
      to join the arts of government, if they exerted as much ingenuity and
      solicitude in relieving the people of God, as they do in whatever concerns
      their military affairs, no nation in the world would be preferable to
      them, or worthier of command. But the people under their dominion groan
      everywhere, and are reduced to poverty and distress. Oh God! come to the
      assistance of thine afflicted servants, and deliver them from the
      oppressions which they suffer.&rdquo;

    <p>
      It was impossible, however, that even the military establishment should
      long continue exempt from the vices which pervaded every other part of the
      government. Rapacity, luxury, and the spirit of insubordination spread
      from the civil service to the officers of the army, and from the officers
      to the soldiers. The evil continued to grow till every mess-room became
      the seat of conspiracy and cabal, and till the sepoys could be kept in
      order only by wholesale executions. <span class="pagenum">269</span><a
      name="link269" id="link269"></a>At length the state of things in Bengal
      began to excite uneasiness at home. A succession of revolutions; a
      disorganized administration; the natives pillaged, yet the Company not
      enriched; every fleet bringing back fortunate adventurers who were able to
      purchase manors and to build stately dwellings, yet bringing back also
      alarming accounts of the financial prospects of the government; war on the
      frontiers; disaffection in the army; the national character disgraced by
      excesses resembling those of Verres and Pizarro; such was the spectacle
      which dismayed those who were conversant with Indian affairs. The general
      cry was that Clive, and Clive alone, could save the empire which he had
      founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling manifested itself in the strongest manner at a very full
      General Court of Proprietors. Men of all parties, forgetting their feuds
      and trembling for their dividends, exclaimed that Clive was the man whom
      the crisis required, that the oppressive proceedings which had been
      adopted respecting his estate ought to be dropped, and that he ought to be
      entreated to return to India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive rose. As to his estate, he said, he would make such propositions to
      the Directors, as would, he trusted, lead to an amicable settlement. But
      there was a still greater difficulty. It was proper to tell them that he
      never would undertake the government of Bengal while his enemy Sulivan was
      chairman of the Company. The tumult was violent. Sulivan could scarcely
      obtain a hearing. An overwhelming majority of the assembly was on Clive&rsquo;s
      side. Sulivan wished to try the result of a ballot. But, according to the
      by-laws of the Company, there, can be no ballot except on a requisition
      signed by nine proprietors; and, though <span class="pagenum">270</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a>hundreds were present, nine persons could
      not be found to set their hands to such a requisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive was in consequence nominated Governor and Commander-in-chief of the
      British possessions in Bengal. But he adhered to his declaration, and
      refused to enter on his office till the event of the next election of
      Directors should be known. The contest was obstinate; but Clive triumphed.
      Sulivan, lately absolute master of the India House, was within a vote of
      losing his own seat; and both the chairman and the deputy-chairman were
      friends of the new governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the circumstances under which Lord Clive sailed for the third
      and last time to India. In May, 1765, he reached Calcutta; and he found
      the whole machine of government even more fearfully disorganized than he
      had anticipated. Meer Jaffier, who had some time before lost his eldest
      son Meeran, had died while Clive was on his voyage out. The English
      functionaries at Calcutta had already received from home strict orders not
      to accept presents from the native princes. But, eager for gain, and
      unaccustomed to respect the commands of their distant, ignorant, and
      negligent masters, they again set up the throne of Bengal to sale. About
      one hundred and forty thousand pounds sterling was distributed among nine
      of the most powerful servants of the Company; and, in consideration of
      this bribe, an infant son of the deceased Nabob was placed on the seat of
      his father. The news of the ignominious bargain met Clive on his arrival.
      In a private letter, written immediately after his landing, to an intimate
      friend, he poured out his feelings in language which, proceeding from a
      man so daring, so resolute, and so little given to theatrical display of
      sentiment, seems to us singularly touching. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he <span
      class="pagenum">271</span><a name="link271" id="link271"></a>says, &ldquo;how is
      the English name sunk! I could not avoid paying the tribute of a few tears
      to the departed and lost fame of the British nation&mdash;irrecoverably
      so, I fear. However, I do declare, by that great Being who is the searcher
      of all hearts, and to whom we must be accountable if there be a hereafter,
      that I am come out with a mind superior to all corruption, and that I am
      determined to destroy these great and growing evils, or perish in the
      attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Council met, and Clive stated to them his full determination to make a
      thorough reform, and to use for that purpose the whole of the ample
      authority, civil and military, which had been confided to him. Johnstone,
      one of the boldest and worst men in the assembly, made some show of
      opposition. Clive interrupted him, and haughtily demanded whether he meant
      to question the power of the new government. Johnstone was cowed, and
      disclaimed any such intention. All the faces round the board grew long and
      pale; and not another syllable of dissent was uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive redeemed his pledge. He remained in India about a year and a half;
      and in that short time effected one of the most extensive, difficult, and
      salutary reforms that ever was accomplished by any statesman. This was the
      part of his life on which he afterwards looked back with most pride. He
      had it in his power to triple his already splendid fortune; to connive at
      abuses while pretending to remove them; to conciliate the good-will of all
      the English in Bengal, by giving up to their rapacity a helpless and timid
      race, who knew not where lay the island which sent forth their oppressors,
      and whose complaints had little chance of being heard across fifteen
      thousand miles of ocean. He knew that if he applied himself in earnest to
      the work <span class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272" id="link272"></a>of
      reformation, he should raise every bad passion in arms against him. He
      knew how unscrupulous, how implacable, would be the hatred of those
      ravenous adventurers who, having counted on accumulating in a few months
      fortunes sufficient to support peerages, should find all their hopes
      frustrated. But he had chosen the good part; and he called up all the
      force of his mind for a battle far harder than that of Plassey. At first
      success seemed hopeless; but soon all obstacles began to bend before that
      iron courage and that vehement will. The receiving of presents from the
      natives was rigidly prohibited. The private trade of the servants of the
      Company was put down. The whole settlement seemed to be set, as one man,
      against these measures. But the inexorable governor declared that, if he
      could not find support at Fort William, he would procure it elsewhere, and
      sent for some civil servants from Madras to assist him in carrying on the
      administration. The most factious of his opponents he turned out of their
      offices. The rest submitted to what was inevitable; and in a very short
      time all resistance was quelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clive was far too wise a man not to see that the recent abuses were
      partly to be ascribed to a cause which could not fail to produce similar
      abuses, as soon as the pressure of his strong hand was withdrawn. The
      Company had followed a mistaken policy with respect to the remuneration of
      its servants. The salaries were too low to afford even those indulgences
      which are necessary to the health and comfort of Europeans in a tropical
      climate. To lay by a rupee from such scanty pay was impossible. It could
      not be supposed that men of even average abilities would consent to pass
      the best years of life in exile, under a burning sun. <span class="pagenum">273</span><a
      name="link273" id="link273"></a>for no other consideration than these
      stinted wages. It had accordingly been understood, from a very early
      period, that the Company&rsquo;s agents were at liberty to enrich themselves by
      their private trade. This practice had been seriously injurious to the
      commercial interests of the corporation. That very intelligent observer,
      Sir Thomas Roe, in the reign of James the First, strongly urged the
      Directors to apply a remedy to the abuse. &ldquo;Absolutely prohibit the private
      trade,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for your business will be better done. I know this is
      harsh. Men profess they come not for bare wages. But you will take away
      this plea if you give great wages to their content; and then you know what
      you part from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this excellent advice, the Company adhered to the old system,
      paid low salaries, and connived at the indirect gains of the agents. The
      pay of a member of Council was only three hundred pounds a year. Yet it
      was notorious that such a functionary could not live in India for less
      than ten times that sum; and it could not be expected that he would be
      content to live even handsomely in India without laying up something
      against the time of his return to England. This system, before the
      conquest of Bengal, might affect the amount of the dividends payable to
      the proprietors, but could do little harm in any other way. But the
      Company was now a ruling body. Its servants might still be called factors,
      junior merchants, senior merchants. But they were in truth proconsuls,
      proprætors, procurators of extensive regions. They had immense power.
      Their regular pay was universally admitted to be insufficient. They were,
      by the ancient usage of the service, and by the implied permission of
      their employers, warranted in enriching <span class="pagenum">274</span><a
      name="link274" id="link274"></a>themselves by indirect means; and this had
      been the origin of the frightful oppression and corruption which had
      desolated Bengal. Clive saw clearly that it was absurd to give men power,
      and to require them to live in penury. He justly concluded that no reform
      could be effectual which should not be coupled with a plan for liberally
      remunerating the civil servants of the Company. The Directors, he knew,
      were not disposed to sanction any increase of the salaries out of their
      own treasury. The only course which remained open to the governor was one
      which exposed him to much misrepresentation, but which we think him fully
      justified in adopting. He appropriated to the support of the service the
      monopoly of salt, which has formed, down to our own time, a principal head
      of Indian revenue; and he divided the proceeds according to a scale which
      seems to have been not unreasonably fixed. He was in consequence accused
      by his enemies, and has been accused by historians, of disobeying his
      instructions, of violating his promises, of authorising that very abuse
      which it was his special mission to destroy, namely the trade of the
      Company&rsquo;s servants. But every discerning and impartial judge will admit,
      that there was really nothing in common between the system which he set up
      and that which he was sent to destroy. The monopoly of salt had been a
      source of revenue to the governments of India before Clive was born. It
      continued to be so long after his death. The civil servants were clearly
      entitled to a maintenance out of the revenue; and all that Clive did was
      to charge a particular portion of the revenue with their maintenance. He
      thus, while he put an end to the practices by which gigantic fortunes had
      been rapidly accumulated, gave to every British functionary employed in
      the East the means <span class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275"
       id="link275"></a>of slowly, but surely, acquiring a competence. Yet, such
      is the injustice of mankind, that none of those acts which are the real
      stains of his life has drawn on him so much obloquy as this measure, which
      was in truth a reform necessary to the success of all his other reforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had quelled the opposition of the civil service: that of the army was
      more formidable. Some of the retrenchments which had been ordered by the
      Directors affected the interests of the military service; and a storm
      arose, such as even Caesar would not willingly have faced. It was no light
      thing to encounter the resistance of those who held the power of the
      sword, in a country governed only by the sword. Two hundred English
      officers engaged in a conspiracy against the government, and determined to
      resign their commissions on the same day, not doubting that Clive would
      grant any terms rather than see the army, on which alone the British
      empire in the East rested, left without commanders. They little knew the
      unconquerable spirit with which they had to deal. Clive had still a few
      officers round his person on whom he could rely. He sent to Fort St.
      George for a fresh supply. He gave commissions even to mercantile agents
      who were disposed to support him at this crisis; and he sent orders that
      every officer who resigned should be instantly brought up to Calcutta. The
      conspirators found that they had miscalculated. The governor was
      inexorable. The troops were steady. The sepoys, over whom Clive had always
      possessed extraordinary influence, stood by him with unshaken fidelity.
      The leaders in the plot were arrested, tried, and cashiered. The rest,
      humbled and dispirited, begged to be permitted to withdraw their
      resignations. Many of them declared their <span class="pagenum">276</span><a
      name="link276" id="link276"></a>repentance even with tears. The younger
      offenders Clive treated with lenity. To the ringleaders he was inflexibly
      severe; but his severity was pure from all taint of private malevolence.
      While he sternly upheld the just authority of his office, he passed by
      personal insults and injuries with magnanimous disdain. One of the
      conspirators was accused of having planned the assassination of the
      governor; but Clive would not listen to the charge. &ldquo;The officers,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;are Englishmen, not assassins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he reformed the civil service and established his authority over the
      army, he was equally successful in his foreign policy. His landing on
      Indian ground was the signal for immediate peace. The Nabob of Oude, with
      a large army, lay at that time on the frontier of Baliar. He had been
      joined by many Afghans and Mahrattas, and there was no small reason to
      expect a general coalition of all the native powers against the English.
      But the name of Clive quelled in an instant all opposition. The enemy
      implored peace in the humblest language, and submitted to such terms as
      the new governor chose to dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, the Government of Bengal was placed on a new footing.
      The power of the English in that province had hitherto been altogether
      undefined. It was unknown to the ancient constitution of the empire, and
      it had been ascertained by no compact. It resembled the power which, in
      the last decrepitude of the Western Empire, was exercised over Italy by
      the great chiefs of foreign mercenaries, the Ricimers and the Odoacers,
      who put up and pulled down at their pleasure a succession of insignificant
      princes, dignified with the names of Cæsar and Augustus. But as in Italy,
      so in India, the warlike strangers at length found <span class="pagenum">277</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a>it expedient to give to a domination which
      had been established by arms the sanction of law and ancient prescription.
      Theodoric thought it politic to obtain from the distant court of Byzantium
      a commission appointing him ruler of Italy; and Clive, in the same manner,
      applied to the Court of Delhi for a formal grant of the powers of which he
      already possessed the reality. The Mogul was absolutely helpless; and,
      though he murmured, had reason to be well pleased that the English were
      disposed to give solid rupees, which he never could have extorted from
      them, in exchange for a few Persian characters which cost him nothing. A
      bargain was speedily struck; and the titular sovereign of Hindostan issued
      a warrant, empowering the Company to collect and administer the revenues
      of Bengal, Orissa, and Baliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still a Nabob, who stood to the British authorities in the same
      relation in which the last drivelling Chilperics and Childerics of the
      Merovingian line stood to their able and vigorous Mayors of the Palace, to
      Charles Martel and to Pepin. At one time Clive had almost made up his mind
      to discard this phantom altogether: but he afterwards thought that it
      might be convenient still to use the name of the Nabob, particularly in
      dealings with other European nations. The French, the Dutch, and the
      Danes, would, he conceived, submit far more readily to the authority of
      the native Prince, whom they had always been accustomed to respect, than
      to that of a rival trading corporation. This policy may, at that time,
      have been judicious. But the pretence was soon found to be too flimsy to
      impose on anybody; and it was altogether laid aside. The heir of Meer
      Jaffier still resides at Moorshedabad, the ancient capital of his house,
      still bears the title of <span class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278"
       id="link278"></a>Nabob, is still accosted by the English as &ldquo;Your
      Highness,&rdquo; and is still suffered to retain a portion of the regal state
      which surrounded his ancestors. A pension of a hundred and sixty thousand
      pounds a year is annually paid to him by the government. His carriage is
      surrounded by guards, and preceded by attendants with silver maces. His
      person and his dwelling are exempted from the ordinary authority of the
      ministers of justice. But he has not the smallest share of political
      power, and is, in fact, only a noble and wealthy subject of the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been easy for Clive, during his second administration in
      Bengal, to accumulate riches, such as no subject in Europe possessed. He
      might indeed, without subjecting the rich inhabitants of the province to
      any pressure beyond that to which their mildest rulers had accustomed
      them, have received presents to the amount of three hundred thousand
      pounds a year. The neighbouring princes would gladly have paid any price
      for his favour. But he appears to have strictly adhered to the rules which
      he had laid down for the guidance of others. The Rajah of Benares offered
      him diamonds of great value. The Nabob of Oude pressed him to accept a
      large sum of money, and a casket of costly jewels. Clive courteously but
      peremptorily refused: and it should be observed that he made no merit of
      his refusal, and that the facts did not come to light till after his
      death. He kept an exact account of his salary, of his share of the profits
      accruing from the trade in salt, and of those presents which, according to
      the fashion of the East, it would be churlish to refuse. Out of the sum
      arising from these resources he defrayed the expenses of his situation.
      The surplus he divided among a few attached friends who had accompanied
      <span class="pagenum">279</span><a name="link279" id="link279"></a>him to
      India. He always boasted, and, as far as we can judge, he boasted with
      truth, that his last administration diminished instead of increasing his
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      One large sum indeed he accepted. Meer Jaffier had left him by will above
      sixty thousand pounds sterling in specie and jewels: and the rules which
      had been recently laid down extended only to presents from the living, and
      did not affect legacies from the dead. Clive took the money, but not for
      himself. He made the whole over to the Company, in trust for officers and
      soldiers invalided in their service. The fund which still bears his name,
      owes its origin to this princely donation. After a stay of eighteen
      months, the state of his health made it necessary for him to return to
      Europe. At the close of January, 1767, he quitted for the last time the
      country, on whose destinies he had exercised so mighty an influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His second return from Bengal was not, like his first, greeted by the
      acclamations of his countrymen. Numerous causes were already at work which
      embittered the remaining years of his life, and hurried him to an untimely
      grave. His old enemies at the India House were still powerful and active;
      and they had been reinforced by a large band of allies, whose violence far
      exceeded their own. The whole crew of pilferers and oppressors from whom
      he had rescued Bengal persecuted him with the implacable rancour which
      belong to such abject natures. Many of them even invested their property
      in India stock, merely that they might be better able to annoy the man
      whose firmness had set bounds to their rapacity. Lying newspapers were set
      up for no purpose but to abuse him; and the temper of the public mind was
      then such, that <span class="pagenum">280</span><a name="link280"
       id="link280"></a>these arts, which under ordinary circumstances would have
      been ineffectual against truth and merit, produced an extraordinary
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great events which had taken place in India had called into existence
      a new class of Englishmen, to whom their countrymen gave the name of
      Nabobs. These persons had generally sprung from families neither ancient
      nor opulent; they had generally been sent at an early age to the East; and
      they had there acquired large fortunes, which they had brought back to
      their native land. It was natural that, not having had much opportunity of
      mixing with the best society, they should exhibit some of the awkwardness
      and some of the pomposity of upstarts. It was natural that, during their
      sojourn in Asia, they should have acquired some tastes and habits
      surprising, if not disgusting, to persons who had never quitted Europe. It
      was natural that, having enjoyed great consideration in the East, they
      should not be disposed to sink into obscurity at home; and as they had
      money, and had not birth or high connection, it was natural that they
      should display a little obtrusively the single advantage that they
      possessed. Wherever they settled there was a kind of feud between them and
      the old nobility and gentry, similar to that which raged in France between
      the farmer-general and the marquess. This enmity to the aristocracy long
      continued to distinguish the servants of the Company. More than twenty
      years after the time of which we are now speaking, Burke pronounced that
      among the Jacobins might be reckoned &ldquo;the East Indians almost to a man,
      who cannot bear to find that their present importance does not bear a
      proportion to their wealth.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nabobs soon became a most unpopular class of men. <span class="pagenum">281</span><a
      name="link281" id="link281"></a>Some of them had in the East displayed
      eminent talents, and rendered great services to the state; but at home
      their talents were not shown to advantage, and their services were little
      known. That they had sprung from obscurity, that they had acquired great
      wealth, that they exhibited it insolently, that they spent it
      extravagantly, that they raised the price of every thing in their
      neighbourhood, from fresh eggs to rotten boroughs, that their liveries
      outshone those of dukes, that their coaches were finer than that of the
      Lord Mayor, that the examples of their large and ill governed households
      corrupted half the servants in the country, that some of them, with all
      their magnificence, could not catch the tone of good society, but, in
      spite of the stud and the crowd of menials, of the plate and the Dresden
      china, of the venison and the Burgundy, were still low men; these were
      things which excited, both in the class from which they had sprung and in
      the class into which they attempted to force themselves, the bitter
      aversion which is the effect of mingled envy and contempt. But when it was
      also rumoured that the fortune which had enabled its possessor to eclipse
      the Lord Lieutenant on the race-ground, or to carry the county against the
      head of a house as old as Domesday Book, had been accumulated by violating
      public faith, by deposing legitimate princes, by reducing whole provinces
      to beggary, all the higher and better as well as all the low and evil
      parts of human nature were stirred against the wretch who had obtained by
      guilt and dishonour the riches which he now lavished with arrogant and
      inelegant profusion. The unfortunate Nabob seemed to be made up of those
      foibles against which comedy has pointed the most merciless ridicule, and
      of those crimes which have thrown the deepest <span class="pagenum">282</span><a
      name="link282" id="link282"></a>gloom over tragedy, of Turcaret and Nero,
      of Monsieur Jourdain and Richard the Third. A tempest of execration and
      derision, such as can be compared only to that outbreak of public feeling
      against the Puritans which took place at the time of the Restoration,
      burst on the servants of the Company. The humane man was horror-struck at
      the way in which they had got their money, the thrifty man at the way in
      which they spent it. The Dilettante sneered at their want of taste. The
      Maccaroni black-balled them as vulgar fellows. Writers the most unlike in
      sentiment and style, Methodists and libertines, philosophers and buffoons,
      were for once on the same side. It is hardly too much to say that, during
      a space of about thirty years, the whole lighter literature of England was
      coloured by the feelings which we have described. Foote brought on the
      stage an Anglo-Indian chief, dissolute, ungenerous, and tyrannical,
      ashamed of the humble friends of his youth, hating the aristocracy, yet
      childishly eager to be numbered among them, squandering his wealth on
      pandars and flatterers, tricking out his chairman with the most costly
      hot-house flowers, and astounding the ignorant with jargon about rupees,
      lacs, and jaghires. Mackenzie, with more delicate humour, depicted a plain
      country family raised by the Indian acquisitions of one of its members to
      sudden opulence, and exciting derision by an awkward mimicry of the
      maimers of the great. Cowper in that lofty expostulation which glows with
      the very spirit of the Hebrew poets, placed the oppression of India
      foremost in the list of those national crimes for which God had punished
      England with years of disastrous war, with discomfiture in her own seas,
      and with the loss of her transatlantic empire. If any of our readers will
      take <span class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283" id="link283"></a>the
      trouble to search in the dusty recesses of circulating libraries for some
      novel published sixty years ago, the chance is that the villain or
      sub-villain of the story will prove to be a savage old Nabob, with an
      immense fortune, a tawny complexion, a bad liver, and a worse heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, as far as we can now judge, was the feeling of the country
      respecting Nabobs in general. And Clive was eminently the Nabob, the
      ablest, the most celebrated, the highest in rank, the highest in fortune,
      of all the fraternity. His wealth was exhibited in a manner which could
      not fail to excite odium. He lived with great magnificence in Berkeley
      Square. He reared one palace in Shropshire and another at Claremont. His
      parliamentary influence might vie with that of the greatest families. But
      in all this splendour and power envy found something to sneer at. On some
      of his relations wealth and dignity seem to have sat as awkwardly as on
      Mackenzie&rsquo;s Margery Mushroom. Nor was he himself, with all his great
      qualities, free from those weaknesses which the satirists of that age
      represented as characteristic of his whole class. In the field, indeed,
      his habits were remarkably simple. He was constantly on horseback, was
      never seen but in his uniform, never wore silk, never entered a palanquin,
      and was content with the plainest fare. But when he was no longer at the
      head of an army, he laid aside this Spartan temperance for the
      ostentatious luxury of a Sybarite. Though his person was ungraceful, and
      though his harsh features were redeemed from vulgar ugliness only by their
      stern, dauntless, and commanding expression, he was fond of rich and gay
      clothing, and replenished his wardrobe with absurd profusion. Sir John
      Malcolm gives us a letter worthy of Sir Matthew Mite, in <span
      class="pagenum">284</span><a name="link284" id="link284"></a>which Clive
      orders &ldquo;two hundred shirts, the best and finest that can be got for love
      or money.&rdquo; A few follies of this description, grossly exaggerated by
      report, produced an unfavourable impression on the public mind. But this
      was not the worst. Black stories, of which the greater part were pure
      inventions, were circulated touching his conduct in the East. He had to
      bear the whole odium, not only of those bad acts to which he had once or
      twice stooped, but of all the bad acts of all the English in India, of bad
      acts committed when he was absent, nay, of bad acts which he had manfully
      opposed and severely punished. The very abuses against which he had waged
      an honest, resolute, and successful war, were laid to his account. He was,
      in fact, regarded as the personification of all the vices and weaknesses
      which the public, with or without reason, ascribed to the English
      adventurers in Asia. We have ourselves heard old men, who knew. nothing of
      his history, but who still retained the prejudices conceived in their
      youth, talk of him as an incarnate fiend. Johnson always held this
      language. Brown, whom Clive employed to lay out his pleasure grounds, was
      amazed to see in the house of his noble employer a chest which had once
      been filled with gold from the treasury of Moorshedabad, and could not
      understand how the conscience of the criminal could suffer him to sleep
      with such an object so near to his bedchamber. The peasantry of Surrey
      looked with mysterious horror on the stately house which was rising at
      Claremont, and whispered that the great wicked lord had ordered the walls
      to be made so thick in order to keep out the devil, who would one day
      carry him away bodily. Among the gaping clowns who drank in this frightful
      story was a worthless <span class="pagenum">285</span><a name="link285"
       id="link285"></a>ugly lad of the name of Hunt, since widely known as
      William Huntington, S. S.; and the superstition which was strangely
      mingled with the knavery of that remarkable impostor seems to have derived
      no small nutriment from the tales which he heard of the life and character
      of Clive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the impulse which Clive had given to the administration
      of Bengal was constantly becoming fainter and fainter. His policy was to a
      great extent abandoned; the abuses which he had suppressed began to
      revive; and at length the evils which a bad government had engendered were
      aggravated by one of those fearful visitations which the best government
      cannot avert. In the summer of 1770, the rains failed; the earth was
      parched up; the tanks were empty; the rivers shrank within their beds; and
      a famine, such as is known only in countries where every household depends
      for support on its own little patch of cultivation, filled the whole
      valley of the Ganges with misery and death. Tender and delicate women,
      whose veils had never been lifted before the public gaze, came forth from
      the inner chambers in which Eastern jealousy had kept watch over their
      beauty, threw themselves on the earth before the passers-by, and, with
      loud wailings, implored a handful of rice for their children. The Hoogley
      every day rolled down thousands of corpses close to the porticoes and
      gardens of the English conquerors. The very streets of Calcutta were
      blocked up by the dying and the dead. The lean and feeble survivors had
      not energy enough to bear the bodies of their kindred to the funeral pile
      or to the holy river, or even to scare away the jackals and vultures, who
      fed on human remains in the face of day. The extent of the mortality <span
      class="pagenum">286</span><a name="link286" id="link286"></a>was never
      ascertained; but it was popularly reckoned by millions. This melancholy
      intelligence added to the excitement which already prevailed in England on
      Indian subjects. The proprietors of East India stock were uneasy about
      their dividends. All men of common humanity were touched by the calamities
      of our unhappy subjects; and indignation soon began to mingle itself with
      pity. It was rumoured that the Company&rsquo;s servants had created the famine
      by engrossing all the rice of the country; that they had sold grain for
      eight, ten, twelve times the price at which they had bought it; that one
      English functionary who, the year before, was not worth a hundred guineas,
      had, during that season of misery, remitted sixty thousand pounds to
      London. These charges we believe to have been unfounded. That servants of
      the Company had ventured, since Clive&rsquo;s departure, to deal in rice, is
      probable. That, if they dealt in rice, they must have gained by the
      scarcity, is certain. But there is no reason for thinking that they either
      produced or aggravated an evil which physical causes sufficiently explain.
      The outcry which was raised against them on this occasion was, we suspect,
      as absurd as the imputations which, in times of dearth at home, were once
      thrown by statesmen and judges, and are still thrown by two or three old
      women, on the corn factors. It was, however, so loud and so general that
      it appears to have imposed even on an intellect raised so high above
      vulgar prejudices as that of Adam Smith. What was still more
      extraordinary, these unhappy events greatly increased the unpopularity of
      Lord Clive. He had been some years in England when the famine took place.
      None of his acts had the smallest tendency to produce such a calamity. If
      the <span class="pagenum">287</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>servants
      of the Company had traded in rice, they had done so in direct
      contravention of the rule which he had laid down, and, while in power, had
      resolutely enforced. But, in the eyes of his countrymen, he was, as we
      have said, the Nabob, the Anglo-Indian character personified; and, while
      he was building and planting in Surrey, he was held responsible for all
      the effects of a dry season in Bengal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parliament had hitherto bestowed very little attention on our Eastern
      possessions. Since the death of George the Second, a rapid succession of
      weak administrations, each of which was in turn flattered and betrayed by
      the Court, had held the semblance of power. Intrigues in the palace, riots
      in the capital, and insurrectionary movements in the American colonies,
      had left the advisers of the crown little leisure to study Indian
      politics. When they did interfere, their interference was feeble and
      irresolute. Lord Chatham, indeed, during the short period of his
      ascendency in the councils of George the Third, had meditated a bold
      attack on the Company. But his plans were rendered abortive by the strange
      malady which about that time began to overcloud his splendid genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in 1772, it was generally felt that Parliament could no longer
      neglect the affairs of India. The Government was stronger than any which
      had held power since the breach between Mr. Pitt and the great Whig
      connection in 1761. No pressing question of domestic or European policy
      required the attention of public men. There was a short and delusive lull
      between two tempests. The excitement produced by the Middlesex election
      was over; the discontents of America did not yet threaten civil war; the
      financial difficulties of the Company brought on a crisis; the <span
      class="pagenum">288</span><a name="link288" id="link288"></a>Ministers
      were forced to take up the subject; and the whole storm, which had long
      been gathering, now broke at once on the head of Clive.
    </p>
    <p>
      His situation was indeed singularly unfortunate. He was hated throughout
      the country, hated at the India House, hated, above all, by those wealthy
      and powerful servants of the Company, whose rapacity and tyranny he had
      withstood. He had to bear the double odium of his bad and of his good
      actions, of every Indian abuse and of every Indian reform. The state of
      the political world was such that he could count on the support of no
      powerful connection. The party to which he had belonged, that of George
      Grenville, had been hostile to the Government, and yet had never cordially
      united with the other sections of the Opposition, with the little hand
      which still followed the fortunes of Lord Chatham, or with the large and
      respectable body of which Lord Rockingham was the acknowledged leader.
      George Grenville was now dead: his followers were scattered; and Clive,
      unconnected with any of the powerful factions which divided the
      Parliament, could reckon only on the votes of those members who were
      returned by himself. His enemies, particularly those who were the enemies
      of his virtues, were unscrupulous, ferocious, implacable. Their
      malevolence aimed at nothing less than the utter ruin of his fame and
      fortune. They wished to see him expelled from Parliament, to see his spurs
      chopped off, to see his estate confiscated; and it may be doubted whether
      even such a result as this would have quenched their thirst for revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive&rsquo;s parliamentary tactics resembled his military tactics. Deserted,
      surrounded, outnumbered, and with every thing at stake, he did not even
      deign to stand <span class="pagenum">289</span><a name="link289"
       id="link289"></a>on the defensive, but pushed boldly forward to the
      attack. At an early stage of the discussions on Indian affairs he rose,
      and in a long and elaborate speech vindicated himself from a large part of
      the accusations which had been brought against him. He is said to have
      produced a great impression on his audience. Lord Chatham, who, now the
      ghost of his former self, loved to haunt the scene of his glory, was that
      night under the gallery of the House of Commons, and declared that he had
      never heard a finer speech. It was subsequently printed under Clive&rsquo;s
      direction, and, when the fullest allowance has been made for the
      assistance which he may have obtained from literary friends, proves him to
      have possessed, not merely strong sense and a manly spirit, but talents
      both for disquisition and declamation which assiduous culture might have
      improved into the highest excellence. He confined his defence on this
      occasion to the measures of his last administration, and succeeded so far
      that his enemies thenceforth thought it expedient to direct their attacks
      chiefly against the earlier part of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earlier part of his life unfortunately presented some assailable
      points to their hostility. A committee was chosen by ballot to inquire
      into the affairs of India; and by this committee the whole history of that
      great revolution which threw down Surajah Dowlah and raised Meer Jaffier
      was sifted with malignant care. Clive was subjected to the most unsparing
      examination and cross-examination, and afterwards bitterly complained that
      he, the Baron of Plassey, had been treated like a sheep-stealer. The
      boldness and ingenuousness of his replies would alone suffice to show how
      alien from his nature were the frauds to which, in the course of his
      eastern negotiations, he had sometimes descended. <span class="pagenum">290</span><a
      name="link290" id="link290"></a>He avowed the arts which he had employed
      to deceive Omichund, and resolutely said that he was not ashamed of them,
      and that, in the same circumstances, he would again act in the same
      manner. He admitted that he had received immense sums from Meer Jaffier;
      but he denied that, in doing so, he had violated any obligation of
      morality or honour. He laid claim, on the contrary, and not without some
      reason, to the praise of eminent disinterestedness. He described in vivid
      language the situation in which his victory had placed him; great princes
      dependent on his pleasure; an opulent city afraid of being given up to
      plunder; wealthy bankers bidding against each other for his smiles; vaults
      piled with gold and jewels thrown open to him alone. &ldquo;By God, Mr.
      Chairman,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;at this moment I stand astonished at my own
      moderation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inquiry was so extensive that the House rose before it had been
      completed. It was continued in the following session. When at length the
      committee had concluded its labours, enlightened and impartial men had
      little difficulty in making up their minds as to the result. It was clear
      that Clive had been guilty of some acts which it is impossible to
      vindicate without attacking the authority of all the most sacred laws
      which regulate the intercourse of individuals and of states. But it was
      equally clear that he had displayed great talents, and even great virtues;
      that he had rendered eminent services both to his country and to the
      people of India; and that it was in truth not for his dealings with Meer
      Jaffier, nor for the fraud which he had practised on Omichund, but for his
      determined resistance to avarice and tyranny, that he was now called in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinary criminal justice knows nothing of set-off. <span class="pagenum">291</span><a
      name="link291" id="link291"></a>The greatest desert cannot be pleaded in
      answer to a charge of the slightest transgression. If a man has sold beer
      on Sunday morning, it is no defence that he has saved the life of a
      fellow-creature at the risk of his own. If he has harnessed a Newfoundland
      dog to his little child&rsquo;s carriage, it is no defence that he was wounded
      at Waterloo. But it is not in this way that we ought to deal with men who,
      raised far above ordinary restraints, and tried by far more than ordinary
      temptations, are entitled to a more than ordinary measure of indulgence.
      Such men should be judged by their contemporaries as they will be judged
      by posterity. Their bad actions ought not, indeed, to be called good; but
      their good and bad actions ought to be fairly weighed; and if on the whole
      the good preponderate, the sentence ought to be one, not merely of
      acquittal, but of approbation. Not a single great ruler in history can be
      absolved by a judge who fixes his eye inexorably on one or two
      unjustifiable acts. Bruce the deliverer of Scotland, Maurice the deliverer
      of Germany, William the deliverer of Holland, his great descendant the
      deliverer of England, Murray the good regent, Cosmo the father of his
      country, Henry the Fourth of France, Peter the Great of Russia, how would
      the best of them pass such a scrutiny? History takes wider views; and the
      best tribunal for great political cases is the tribunal which anticipates
      the verdict of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reasonable and moderate men of all parties felt this in Clive&rsquo;s case. They
      could not pronounce him blameless; but they were not disposed to abandon
      him to that low-minded and rancorous pack who had run him down and were
      eager to worry him to death. Lord North, though not very friendly to him,
      was not disposed to go to extremities against him. While the inquiry was
      <span class="pagenum">292</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>still
      in progress, Clive, who had some years before been created a Knight of the
      Bath, was installed with great pomp in Henry the Seventh&rsquo;s Chapel. He was
      soon after appointed Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. When he kissed hands,
      George the Third, who had always been partial to him, admitted him to a
      private audience, talked to him half an hour on Indian politics, and was
      visibly affected when the persecuted general spoke of his services and of
      the way in which they had been requited.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the charges came in a definite form before the House of Commons.
      Burgoyne, chairman of the committee, a man of wit, fashion, and honour, an
      agreeable dramatic writer, an officer whose courage was never questioned,
      and whose skill was at that time highly esteemed, appeared as the accuser.
      The members of the administration took different sides; for in that age
      all questions were open questions, except such as were brought forward by
      the Government, or such as implied some censure on the Government.
      Thurlow, the Attorney General, was among the assailants. Wedderbume, the
      Solicitor General, strongly attached to Clive, defended his friend with
      extraordinary force of argument and language. It is a curious circumstance
      that, some years later, Thurlow was the most conspicuous champion of
      Warren Hastings, while Wedderburne was among the most unrelenting
      persecutors of that great though not faultless statesman. Clive spoke in
      his own defence at less length and with less art than in the preceding
      year, but with much energy and pathos. He recounted his great actions and
      his wrongs; and, after bidding his hearers remember, that they were about
      to decide not only on his honour but on their own; he retired from the
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commons resolved that acquisitions made by <span class="pagenum">293</span><a
      name="link293" id="link293"></a>the arms of the State belong to the State
      alone, and that it is illegal in the servants of the State to appropriate
      such acquisitions to themselves. They resolved that this wholesome rule
      appeared to have been systematically violated by the English functionaries
      in Bengal. On a subsequent day they went a step farther, and resolved that
      Clive had, by means of the power, which he possessed as commander of the
      British forces in India, obtained large sums from Meer Jaffier. Here the
      Commons stopped. They had voted the major and minor of Burgoyne&rsquo;s
      syllogism; but they shrank from drawing the logical conclusion. When it
      was moved that Lord Clive had abused his powers, and set an evil example
      to the servants of the public, the previous question was put and carried.
      At length, long after the sun had risen on an animated debate, Wedderburne
      moved that Lord Clive had at the same time rendered great and meritorious
      services to his country; and this motion passed without a division.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this memorable inquiry appears to us, on the whole,
      honourable to the justice, moderation, and discernment of the Commons.
      They had indeed no great temptation to do wrong. They would have been very
      bad judges of an accusation brought against Jenkinson or against Wilkes.
      But the question respecting Clive was not a party question; and the House
      accordingly acted with the good sense and good feeling which may always be
      expected from an assembly of English gentlemen not blinded by faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equitable and temperate proceedings of the British Parliament were set
      off to the greatest advantage by a foil. The wretched government of Lewis
      the Fifteenth had murdered, directly or indirectly, almost every Frenchman
      who had served his country <span class="pagenum">294</span><a
      name="link294" id="link294"></a>with distinction in the East.
      Labourdonnais was flung into the Bastile, and, after years of suffering,
      left it only to die. Dupleix, stripped of his immense fortune, and
      broken-hearted by humiliating attendance in antechambers, sank into an
      obscure grave. Lally was dragged to the common place of execution with a
      gag between his lips. The Commons of England, on the other hand, treated
      their living captain with that discriminating justice which is seldom
      shown except to the dead. They laid down sound general principles; they
      delicately pointed out where he had deviated from those principles; and
      they tempered the gentle censure with liberal eulogy. The contrast struck
      Voltaire, always partial to England, and always eager to expose the abuses
      of the Parliaments of France. Indeed he seems, at this time, to have
      meditated a history of the conquest of Bengal. He mentioned his design to
      Dr. Moore when that amusing writer visited him at Ferney. Wedderburne took
      great interest in the matter, and pressed Clive to furnish materials. Had
      the plan been carried into execution, we have no doubt that Voltaire would
      have produced a book containing much lively and picturesque narrative,
      many just and humane sentiments poignantly expressed, many grotesque
      blunders, many sneers at the Mosaic chronology, much scandal about the
      Catholic missionaries, and much sublime theo-philanthropy, stolen from the
      New Testament, and put into the mouths of virtuous and philosophical
      Brahmins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive was now secure in the enjoyment of his fortune and his honours. He
      was surrounded by attached friends and relations; and he had not yet
      passed the season of vigorous bodily and mental exertion. But clouds had
      long been gathering over his mind, and now <span class="pagenum">295</span><a
      name="link295" id="link295"></a>settled on it in thick darkness. From
      early youth he had been subject to fits of that strange melancholy &ldquo;which
      rejoiceth exceedingly and is glad when it can find the grave.&rdquo; While still
      a writer at Madras, he had twice attempted to destroy himself. Business
      and prosperity had produced a salutary effect on his spirits. In India,
      while he was occupied by great affairs, in England, while wealth and rank
      had still the charm of novelty, he had borne up against his constitutional
      misery. But he had now nothing to do and nothing to wish for. His active
      spirit in an inactive situation drooped and withered like a plant in an
      uncongenial air. The malignity with which his enemies had pursued him, the
      indignity with which he had been treated by the committee, the censure,
      lenient as it was, which the House of Commons had pronounced, the
      knowledge that he was regarded by a large portion of his countrymen as a
      cruel and perfidious tyrant, all concurred to irritate and depress him. In
      the mean time his temper was tried by acute physical suffering. During his
      long residence in tropical climates, he had contracted several painful
      distempers. In order to obtain ease he called in the help of opium; and he
      was gradually enslaved by this treacherous ally. To the last, however, his
      genius occasionally flashed through the gloom. It was said that he would
      sometimes, after sitting silent and torpid for hours, rouse himself to the
      discussion of some great question, would display in full vigour all the
      talents of the soldier and the statesman, and would then sink back into
      his melancholy repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disputes with America had now become so serious that an appeal to the
      sword seemed inevitable; and the Ministers were desirous to avail
      themselves of the services of Clive. Had he still been what he was when
      <span class="pagenum">296</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>he
      raised the siege of Patna, and annihilated the Dutch army and navy at the
      mouth of the Ganges, it is not improbable that the resistance of the
      Colonists would have been put down, and that the inevitable separation
      would have been deferred for a few years. But it was too late. His strong
      mind was fast sinking under many kinds of suffering. On the twenty-second
      of November, 1774, he died by his own hand. He had just completed his
      forty-ninth year.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the awful close of so much prosperity and glory, the vulgar saw only a
      confirmation of all their prejudices; and some men of real piety and
      genius so far forgot the maxims both of religion and of philosophy as
      confidently to ascribe the mournful event to the just vengeance of God,
      and to the horrors of an evil conscience. It is with very different
      feelings that we contemplate the spectacle of a great mind ruined by the
      weariness of satiety, by the pangs of wounded honour, by fatal diseases,
      and more fatal remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clive committed great faults; and we have not attempted to disguise them.
      But his faults, when weighed against his merits, and viewed in connection
      with his temptations, do not appear to us to deprive him of his right to
      an honourable place in the estimation of posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his first visit to India dates the renown of the English arms in the
      East. Till he appeared, his countrymen were despised as mere pedlars,
      while the French were revered as a people formed for victory and command.
      His courage and capacity dissolved the charm. With the defence of Arcot
      commences that long series of Oriental triumph which closes with the fall
      of Ghizni. Nor must we forget that he was only twenty-five years old when
      he approved himself ripe for military command. <span class="pagenum">297</span><a
      name="link297" id="link297"></a>This is a rare if not a singular
      distinction. It is true that Alexander, Condé, and Charles the Twelfth,
      won great battles at a still earlier age; but those princes were
      surrounded by veteran generals of distinguished skill, to whose
      suggestions must be attributed the victories of the Granicus, of Rocroi,
      and of Narva. Clive, an inexperienced youth, had yet more experience than
      any of those who served under him. He had to form himself, to form his
      officers, and to form his army. The only man, as far as we recollect, who
      at an equally early age ever gave equal proof of talents for war, was
      Napoleon Bonaparte.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Clive&rsquo;s second visit to India dates the political ascendency of the
      English in that country. His dexterity and resolution realised, in the
      course of a few months, more than all the gorgeous visions which had
      floated before the imagination of Dupleix. Such an extent of cultivated
      territory, such an amount of revenue, such a multitude of subjects, was
      never added to the dominion of Rome by the most successful proconsul. Nor
      were such wealthy spoils ever borne under arches of triumph, down the
      Sacred Way, and through the crowded Forum, to the threshold of Tarpeian
      Jove. The fame of those who subdued Antiochus and Tigranes grows dim when
      compared with the splendour of the exploits which the young English
      adventurer achieved at the head of an army not equal in numbers to one
      half of a Roman legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Clive&rsquo;s third visit to India dates the purity of our Eastern empire.
      When he landed in Calcutta in 1765, Bengal was regarded as a place to
      which Englishmen were sent only to get rich, by any means, in the shortest
      possible time. He first made dauntless and unsparing war on that gigantic
      system of oppression, <span class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298"
       id="link298"></a>extortion, and corruption. In that war he manfully put to
      hazard his ease, his fame, and his splendid fortune. The same sense of
      justice which forbids us to conceal or extenuate the faults of his earlier
      days compels us to admit that those faults were nobly repaired. If the
      reproach of the Company and of its servants has been taken away, if in
      India the yoke of foreign masters, elsewhere the heaviest of all yokes,
      has been found lighter than that of any native dynasty, if to that gang of
      public robbers, which formerly spread terror through the whole plain of
      Bengal, has succeeded a body of functionaries not more highly
      distinguished by ability and diligence than by integrity,
      disinterestedness, and public spirit, if we now see such men as Munro,
      Elphinstone, and Metcalfe, after leading victorious armies, after making
      and deposing kings, return, proud of their honourable poverty, from a land
      which once held out to every greedy factor the hope of boundless wealth,
      the praise is in no small measure due to Clive. His name stands high on
      the roll of conquerors. But it is found in a better list, in the list of
      those who have done and suffered much for the happiness of mankind. To the
      warrior, history will assign a place in the same rank with Lucullus and
      Trajan. Nor will she deny to the reformer a share of that veneration with
      which France cherishes the memory of Turgot, and with which the latest
      generations of Hindoos will contemplate the statue of Lord William
      Bentinck.

      necessary for us to say that this is an excellent book excellently
      translated. The original work of Professor Ranke is known and esteemed
      wherever German literature is studied, and has been found interesting even
      in a most inaccurate and dishonest French version. It is, indeed, the work
      of a mind fitted both for minute researches and for large speculations. It
      is written also in an admirable spirit, equally remote from levity and
      bigotry, serious and earnest, yet tolerant and impartial. It is,
      therefore, with the greatest pleasure that we now see this book take its
      place among the English classics. Of the translation we need only say that
      it is such as might be expected from the skill, the taste, and the
      scrupulous integrity of the accomplished lady who, as an interpreter
      between the mind of Germany and the mind of Britain, has already deserved
      so well of both countries.

      of Rome, having lost a large part of Europe, not only ceased to lose, but
      actually regained nearly half of what she had lost, is certainly a most
      curious and important question; and on this question Professor Ranke has
      thrown far more light than any other person who has written on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not, and there never was on this earth, a work of human policy so
      well deserving of examination as the Roman Catholic Church. The history of
      that Church joins together the two great ages of human civilisation. No
      other institution is left standing which carries the mind back to the
      times when the smoke of sacrifice rose from the Pantheon, and when
      camelopards and tigers bounded in the Flavian amphitheatre. The proudest
      royal houses are but of yesterday, when compared with the line of the
      Supreme Pontiffs. That line we trace back in an unbroken series from the
      Pope who crowned Napoleon in the nineteenth century to the Pope who
      crowned Pepin in the eighth; and far beyond the time of Pepin the august
      dynasty extends, till it is lost in the twilight of fable. The republic of
      Venice came next in antiquity. But the republic of Venice was modern when
      compared with the Papacy; and the republic of Venice is gone, and the
      Papacy remains. The Papacy remains, not in decay, not a mere antique, but
      full of life and useful vigour. The Catholic Church is still sending forth
      to the farthest ends of the world missionaries as zealous as those who
      landed in Kent with Augustin, and still confronting hostile kings with the
      same spirit with which she confronted Attila. The number of her children
      is greater than in any former age. Her acquisitions in the New World have
      more than compensated for what she has lost in the Old. Her spiritual
      ascendency extends over the <span class="pagenum">301</span><a
      name="link301" id="link301"></a>vast countries which lie between the
      plains of the Missouri and Cape Horn, countries which, a century hence,
      may not improbably contain a population as large as that which now
      inhabits Europe. The members of her communion are certainly not fewer than
      a hundred and fifty millions; and it will be difficult to show that all
      other Christian sects united amount to a hundred and twenty millions. Nor
      do we see any sign which indicates that the term of her long dominion is
      approaching. She saw the commencement of all the governments and of all
      the ecclesiastical establishments that now exist in the world; and we feel
      no assurance that she is not destined to see the end of them all. She was
      great and respected before the Saxon had set foot on Britain, before the
      Frank had passed the Rhine, when Grecian eloquence still flourished in
      Antioch, when idols were still worshipped in the temple of Mecca. And she
      may still exist in undiminished vigour when some traveller from New
      Zealand shall, in the midst of a vast solitude, take his stand on a broken
      arch of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often hear it said that the world is constantly becoming more and more
      enlightened, and that this enlightening must be favourable to
      Protestantism, and unfavourable to Catholicism. We wish that we could
      think so. But we see great reason to doubt whether this be a well founded
      expectation. We see that during the last two hundred and fifty years the
      human mind has been in the highest degree active, that it has made great
      advances in every branch of natural philosophy, that it has produced
      innumerable inventions tending to promote the convenience of life, that
      medicine, surgery, chemistry, engineering, have been very greatly
      improved, that government, police, and law have been <span class="pagenum">302</span><a
      name="link302" id="link302"></a>improved, though not to so great an extent
      as the physical sciences. But we see that, during these two hundred and
      fifty years, Protestantism has made no conquests worth speaking of. Nay,
      we believe that, as far as there has been a change, that change has, on
      the whole, been in favour of the Church of Rome. We cannot, therefore,
      feel confident that the progress of knowledge will necessarily be fatal to
      a system which has, to say the least, stood its ground in spite of the
      immense progress made by the human race in knowledge since the days of
      Queen Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed the argument which we are considering, seems to us to be founded on
      an entire mistake. There are branches of knowledge with respect to which
      the law of the human mind is progress. In mathematics, when once a
      proposition has been demonstrated, it is never afterwards contested. Every
      fresh story is as solid a basis for a new superstructure as the original
      foundation was. Here, therefore, there is a constant addition to the stock
      of truth. In the inductive sciences again, the law is progress. Every day
      furnishes new facts, and thus brings theory nearer and nearer to
      perfection. There is no chance that, either in the purely demonstrative,
      or in the purely experimental sciences, the world will ever go back or
      even remain stationary. Nobody ever heard of a reaction against Taylor&rsquo;s
      theorem, or of a reaction against Harvey&rsquo;s doctrine of the circulation of
      the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with theology the case is very different. As respects natural
      religion,&mdash;revelation being for the present altogether left out of
      the question,&mdash;it is not easy to see that a philosopher of the
      present day is more favourably situated than Thales or Simonides. He has
      before him just the same evidences of design <span class="pagenum">303</span><a
      name="link303" id="link303"></a>in the structure of the universe which the
      early Greeks had. We say just the same; for the discoveries of modern
      astronomers and anatomists have really added nothing to the force of that
      argument which a reflecting mind finds in every beast, bird, insect, fish,
      leaf, flower, and shell. The reasoning by which Socrates, in Xenophon&rsquo;s
      hearing, confuted the little atheist Aristodemus, is exactly the reasoning
      of Paley&rsquo;s Natural Theology. Socrates makes precisely the same use of the
      statues of Polycletus and the pictures of Zeuxis which Paley makes of the
      watch. As to the other great question, the question, what becomes of man
      after death, we do not see that a highly educated European, left to his
      unassisted reason, is more likely to be in the right than a Blackfoot
      Indian. Not a single one of the many sciences in which we surpass the
      Blackfoot Indians throws the smallest light on the state of the soul after
      the animal life is extinct. In truth all the philosophers, ancient and
      modern, who have attempted, without the help of revelation, to prove the
      immortality of man, from Plato down to Franklin, appear to us to have
      failed deplorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, all the great enigmas which perplex the natural theologian
      are the same in all ages. The ingenuity of a people just emerging from
      barbarism is quite sufficient to propound those enigmas. The genius of
      Locke or Clarke is quite unable to solve them. It is a mistake to imagine
      that subtle speculations touching the Divine attributes, the origin of
      evil, the necessity of human actions, the foundation of moral obligation,
      imply any high degree of intellectual culture. Such speculations, on the
      contrary, are in a peculiar manner the delight of intelligent children and
      of half civilised men. The number of boys is not <span class="pagenum">304</span><a
      name="link304" id="link304"></a>small who, at fourteen, have thought
      enough on these questions to be fully entitled to the praise which
      Voltaire gives to Zadig. &ldquo;Il en savait ce qu&rsquo;on en a su dans tous les
      âges; c&rsquo;est-à-dire, fort peu de chose.&rdquo; The book of Job shows that, long
      before letters and arts were known to Ionia, these vexing questions were
      debated with no common skill and eloquence, under the tents of the Idumean
      Emirs; nor has human reason, in the course of three thousand years,
      discovered any satisfactory solution of the riddles which perplexed
      Eliphaz and Zophar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natural theology, then, is not a progressive science. That knowledge of
      our origin and of our destiny which we derive from revelation is indeed of
      very different clearness, and of very different importance. But neither is
      revealed religion of the nature of a progressive science. All Divine truth
      is, according to the doctrine of the Protestant Churches, recorded in
      certain books. It is equally open to all who, in any age, can read those
      books; nor can all the discoveries of all the philosophers in the world
      add a single verse to any of those books. It is plain, therefore, that in
      divinity there cannot be a progress analogous to that which is constantly
      taking place in pharmacy, geology, and navigation. A Christian of the
      fifth century with a Bible is neither better nor worse situated than a
      Christian of the nineteenth century with a Bible, candour and natural
      acuteness being, of course, supposed equal. It matters not at all that the
      compass, printing, gunpowder, steam, gas, vaccination, and a thousand
      other discoveries and inventions, which were unknown in the fifth century,
      are familiar to the nineteenth. None of these discoveries and inventions
      has the smallest bearing on the question <span class="pagenum">305</span><a
      name="link305" id="link305"></a>whether man is justified by faith alone,
      or whether the invocation of saints is an orthodox practice. It seems to
      us, therefore, that we have no security for the future against the
      prevalence of any theological error that ever has prevailed in time past
      among Christian men. We are confident that the world will never go back to
      the solar system of Ptolemy; nor is our confidence in the least shaken by
      the circumstance, that even so great a man as Bacon rejected the theory of
      Galileo with scorn; for Bacon had not all the means of arriving at a sound
      conclusion which are within our reach, and which secure people who would
      not have been worthy to mend his pens from falling into his mistakes. But
      when we reflect that Sir Thomas More was ready to die for the doctrine of
      transubstantiation, we cannot but feel some doubt whether the doctrine of
      transubstantiation may not triumph over all opposition. More was a man of
      eminent talents. He had all the information on the subject that we have,
      or that, while the world lasts, any human being will have. The text, &ldquo;This
      is my body,&rdquo; was in his New Testament as it is in ours. The absurdity of
      the literal interpretation was as great and as obvious in the sixteenth
      century as it is now. No progress that science has made, or will make, can
      add to what seems to us the overwhelming force of the argument against the
      real presence. We are, therefore, unable to understand why what Sir Thomas
      More believed respecting transubstantiation may not be believed to the end
      of time by men equal in abilities and honesty to Sir Thomas More. But Sir
      Thomas More is one of the choice specimens of human wisdom and virtue; and
      the doctrine of transubstantiation is a kind of proof charge. A faith
      which stands that test will stand any test. The prophecies of Brothers
      <span class="pagenum">306</span><a name="link306" id="link306"></a>and the
      miracles of Prince Hohenlohe sink to trifles in the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      One reservation, indeed, must be made. The books and traditions of a sect
      may contain, mingled with propositions strictly theological, other
      propositions, purporting to rest on the same authority, which relate to
      physics. If new discoveries should throw discredit on the physical
      propositions, the theological propositions, unless they can be separated
      from the physical propositions, will share in that discredit. In this way,
      undoubtedly, the progress of science may indirectly serve the cause of
      religious truth. The Hindoo mythology, for example, is bound up with a
      most absurd geography. Every young Brahmin, therefore, who learns
      geography in our colleges, learns to smile at the Hindoo mythology. If
      Catholicism has not suffered to an equal degree from the Papal decision
      that the sun goes round the earth, this is because all intelligent
      Catholics now hold, with Pascal, that, in deciding the point at all, the
      Church exceeded her powers, and was, therefore, justly left destitute of
      that supernatural assistance which, in the exercise of her legitimate
      functions, the promise of her Founder authorised her to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reservation affects not at all the truth of our proposition, that
      divinity, properly so called, is not a progressive science. A very common
      knowledge of history, a very little observation of life, will suffice to
      prove that no learning, no sagacity, affords a security against the
      greatest errors on subjects relating to the invisible world. Bayle and
      Chillingworth, two of the most sceptical of mankind, turned Catholics from
      sincere conviction. Johnson, incredulous on all other points, was a ready
      believer in miracles and apparitions. He would not believe in Ossian; but
      he was willing to <span class="pagenum">307</span><a name="link307"
       id="link307"></a>believe in the second sight. He would not believe in the
      earthquake of Lisbon; but he was willing to believe in the Cock Lane
      ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these reasons we have ceased to wonder at any vagaries of
      superstition. We have seen men, not of mean intellect or neglected
      education, but qualified by their talents and acquirements to attain
      eminence either in active or speculative pursuits, well read scholars,
      expert logicians, keen observers of life and manners, prophesying,
      interpreting, talking unknown tongues, working miraculous cures, coming
      down with messages from God to the House of Commons. We have seen an old
      woman, with no talents beyond the cunning of a fortune-teller, and with
      the education of a scullion, exalted into a prophetess, and surrounded by
      tens of thousands of devoted followers, many of whom were, in station and
      knowledge, immeasurably her superiors; and all this in the nineteenth
      century; and all this in London. Yet why not? For of the dealings of God
      with man no more has been revealed to the nineteenth century than to the
      first, or to London than to the wildest parish in the Hebrides. It is true
      that, in those things which concern this life and this world, man
      constantly becomes wiser and wiser. But it is no less true that, as
      respects a higher power and a future state, man, in the language of
      Goethe&rsquo;s scoffing fiend, <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;bleibt stets
      von gleichem Schlag, <br /><span class="indent15">Und ist so Wunderlich als
      wie am ersten Tag.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Catholicism strikingly illustrates these observations.
      During the last seven centuries the public mind of Europe has made
      constant progress in every department of secular knowledge. But in
      religion we can trace no constant progress. The ecclesiastical <span
      class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>history of
      that long period is a history of movement to and fro. Four times, since
      the authority of the Church of Rome was established in Western
      Christendom, has the human intellect risen up against her yoke. Twice that
      Church remained completely victorious. Twice she came forth from the
      conflict bearing the marks of cruel wounds, but with the principle of life
      still strong within her. When we reflect on the tremendous assaults which
      she has survived, we find it difficult to conceive in what way she is to
      perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these insurrections broke out in the region where the
      beautiful language of <i>Oc</i> was spoken. That country, singularly
      favoured by nature, was, in the twelfth century, the most flourishing and
      civilised portion of Western Europe. It was in nowise a part of France. It
      had a distinct political existence, a distinct national character,
      distinct usages, and a distinct speech. The soil was fruitful and well
      cultivated; and amidst the cornfields and vineyards arose many rich
      cities, each of which was a little republic, and many stately castles,
      each of which contained a miniature of an imperial court. It was there
      that the spirit of chivalry first laid aside its terrors, first took a
      humane and graceful form, first appeared as the inseparable associate of
      art and literature, of courtesy and love. The other vernacular dialects
      which, since the fifth century, had sprung up in the ancient provinces of
      the Roman empire, were still rude and imperfect. The sweet Tuscan, the
      rich and energetic English, were abandoned to artisans and shepherds. No
      clerk had ever condescended to use such barbarous jargon for the teaching
      of science, for the recording of great events, or for the painting of life
      and manners; But the language of Provence was already the language of the
      learned and polite, and was <span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a>employed by numerous writers, studious of
      all the arts of composition and versification. A literature rich in
      ballads, in war-songs, in satire, and, above all, in amatory poetry,
      amused the leisure of the knights and ladies, whose fortified mansions
      adorned the banks of the Rhone and Garonne. With civilisation had come
      freedom of thought. Use had taken away the horror with which misbelievers
      were elsewhere regarded. No Norman or Breton ever saw a Mussulman, except
      to give and receive blows on some Syrian field of battle. But the people
      of the rich countries which lay under the Pyrenees lived in habits of
      courteous and profitable intercourse with the Moorish kingdoms of Spain,
      and gave a hospitable welcome to skilful leeches and mathematicians who,
      in the schools of Cordova and Granada, had become versed in all the
      learning of the Arabians. The Greek, still preserving, in the midst of
      political degradation, the ready wit and the inquiring spirit of his
      fathers, still able to read the most perfect of human compositions, still
      speaking the most powerful and flexible of human languages, brought to the
      marts of Narbonne and Toulouse, together with the drugs and silks of
      remote climates, bold and subtle theories long unknown to the ignorant and
      credulous West. The Paulician theology, a theology in which, as it should
      seem, many of the doctrines of the modern Calvinists were mingled with
      some doctrines derived from the ancient Manichees, spread rapidly through
      Provence and Languedoc. The clergy of the Catholic Church were regarded
      with loathing and contempt. &ldquo;Viler than a priest,&rdquo; &ldquo;I would as soon be a
      priest,&rdquo; became proverbial expressions. The Papacy had lost all authority
      with all classes, from the great feudal princes down to the cultivators of
      the soil. <span class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a>The
      danger to the hierarchy was indeed formidable. Only one transalpine nation
      had emerged from barbarism; and that nation had thrown off all respect for
      Rome. Only one of the vernacular languages of Europe had yet been
      extensively employed for literary purposes; and that language was a
      machine in the hands of heretics. The geographical position of the
      sectaries made the danger peculiarly formidable. They occupied a central
      region communicating directly with France, with Italy, and with Spain. The
      provinces which were still untainted were separated from each other by
      this infected district. Under these circumstances, it seemed probable that
      a single generation would suffice to spread the reformed doctrine to
      Lisbon, to London, and to Naples. But this was not to be. Rome cried for
      help to the warriors of northern France. She appealed at once to their
      superstition and to their cupidity. To the devout believer she promised
      pardons as ample as those with which she had rewarded the deliverers of
      the Holy Sepulchre. To the rapacious and profligate she offered the
      plunder of fertile plains and wealthy cities. Unhappily, the ingenious and
      polished inhabitants of the Languedocian provinces were far better
      qualified to enrich and embellish their country than to defend it. Eminent
      in the arts of peace, unrivalled in the &ldquo;gay science,&rdquo; elevated above many
      vulgar superstitions, they wanted that iron courage, and that skill in
      martial exercises, which distinguished the chivalry of the region beyond
      the Loire, and were ill fitted to face enemies who, in every country from
      Ireland to Palestine, had been victorious against tenfold odds. A war,
      distinguished even among wars of religion by merciless atrocity, destroyed
      the Albigensian heresy, and with that heresy the <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>prosperity, the civilisation, the
      literature, the national existence, of what was once the most opulent and
      enlightened part of the great European family. Rome, in the mean time,
      warned by that fearful danger from which the exterminating swords of her
      crusaders had narrowly saved her, proceeded to revise and to strengthen
      her whole system of polity. At this period were instituted the Order of
      Francis, the Order of Dominic, the Tribunal of the Inquisition. The new
      spiritual police was everywhere. No alley in a great city, no hamlet on a
      remote mountain, was unvisited by the begging friar. The simple Catholic,
      who was content to be no wiser than his fathers, found, wherever he
      turned, a friendly voice to encourage him. The path of the heretic was
      beset by innumerable spies; and the Church, lately in danger of utter
      subversion, now appeared to be impregnably fortified by the love, the
      reverence, and the terror of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A century and a half passed away; and then came the second great rising up
      of the human intellect against the spiritual domination of Rome. During
      the two generations which followed the Albigensian crusade, the power of
      the Papacy had been at the height. Frederic the Second, the ablest and
      most accomplished of the long line of German Cæsars, had in vain exhausted
      all the resources of military and political skill in the attempt to defend
      the rights of the civil power against the encroachments of the Church. The
      vengeance of the priesthood had pursued his house to the third generation.
      Manfred had perished on the field of battle, Conradin on the scaffold.
      Then a turn took place. The secular authority, long unduly depressed,
      regained the ascendant with startling rapidity. The change is doubtless to
      be ascribed chiefly to the general <span class="pagenum">312</span><a
      name="link312" id="link312"></a>disgust excited by the way in which the
      Church had abused its power and its success. But something must be
      attributed to the character and situation of individuals. The man who bore
      the chief part in effecting this revolution was Philip the Fourth of
      France, surnamed the Beautiful, a despot by position, a despot by
      temperament, stern, implacable, and unscrupulous, equally prepared for
      violence and for chicanery, and surrounded by a devoted band of men of the
      sword and of men of law. The fiercest and most highminded of the Roman
      Pontiffs, while bestowing kingdoms and citing great princes to his
      judgment-seat, was seized in his palace by armed men, and so foully
      outraged that he died mad with rage and terror. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; sang the great
      Florentine poet, &ldquo;was Christ, in the person of his vicar, a second time
      seized by ruffians, a second time mocked, a second time drenched with the
      vinegar and the gall.&rdquo; The seat of the Papal court was carried beyond the
      Alps, and the Bishops of Rome became dependents of France. Then came the
      great schism of the West. Two Popes, each with a doubtful title, made all
      Europe ring with their mutual invectives and anathemas. Rome cried out
      against the corruptions of Avignon; and Avignon, with equal justice,
      recriminated on Rome. The plain Christian people, brought up in the belief
      that it was a sacred duty to be in communion with the head of the Church,
      were unable to discover, amidst conflicting testimonies and conflicting
      arguments, to which of the two worthless priests who were cursing and
      reviling each other, the headship of the Church rightfully belonged. It
      was nearly at this juncture that the voice of John Wickliffe began to make
      itself heard. The public mind of England was soon stirred to its inmost
      depths; and the influence of <span class="pagenum">313</span><a
      name="link313" id="link313"></a>the new doctrines was soon felt, even in
      the distant kingdom of Bohemia. In Bohemia, indeed, there had long been a
      predisposition to heresy. Merchants from the Lower Danube were often seen
      in the fairs of Prague; and the Lower Danube was peculiarly the seat of
      the Paulician theology. The Church, torn by schism, and fiercely assailed
      at once in England and in the German empire, was in a situation scarcely
      less perilous than at the crisis which preceded the Albigensian crusade.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this danger also passed by. The civil power gave its strenuous support
      to the Church; and the Church made some show of reforming itself. The
      Council of Constance put an end to the schism. The whole Catholic world
      was again united under a single chief; and rules were laid down which
      seemed to make it improbable that the power of that chief would be grossly
      abused. The most distinguished teachers of the new doctrine were
      slaughtered. The English government put down the Lollards with merciless
      rigour; and, in the next generation, scarcely one trace of the second
      great revolt against the Papacy could be found, except among the rude
      population of the mountains of Bohemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another century went by; and then began the third and the most memorable
      struggle for spiritual freedom. The times were changed. The great remains
      of Athenian and Roman genius were studied by thousands. The Church had no
      longer a monopoly of learning. The powers of the modern languages had at
      length been developed. The invention of printing had given new facilities
      to the intercourse of mind with mind. With such auspices commenced the
      great Reformation. <span class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314"
       id="link314"></a>We will attempt to lay before our readers, in a short
      compass, what appears to us to be the real history of the contest which
      began with the preaching of Luther against the Indulgences, and which may,
      in one sense, be said to have been terminated, a hundred and thirty years
      later, by the treaty of Westphalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the northern parts of Europe the victory of Protestantism was rapid and
      decisive. The dominion of the Papacy was felt by the nations of Teutonic
      blood as the dominion of Italians, of foreigners, of men who were aliens
      in language, manners, and intellectual constitution. The large
      jurisdiction exercised by the spiritual tribunals of Rome seemed to be a
      degrading badge of servitude. The sums which, under a thousand pretexts,
      were exacted by a distant court, were regarded both as a humiliating and
      as a ruinous tribute. The character of that court excited the scorn and
      disgust of a grave, earnest, sincere, and devout people. The new theology
      spread with a rapidity never known before. All ranks, all varieties of
      character, joined the ranks of the innovators. Sovereigns impatient to
      appropriate to themselves the prerogatives of the Pope, nobles desirous to
      share the plunder of abbeys, suitors exasperated by the extortions of the
      Roman Camera, patriots impatient of a foreign rule, good men scandalized
      by the corruptions of the Church, bad men desirous of the license
      inseparable from great moral revolutions, wise men eager in the pursuit of
      truth, weak men allured by the glitter of novelty, all were found on one
      side. Alone among the northern nations the Irish adhered to the ancient
      faith: and the cause of this seems to have been that the national feeling
      which, in happier countries, was directed against Rome, was in Ireland
      directed against England. Within <span class="pagenum">315</span><a
      name="link315" id="link315"></a>fifty years from the day on which Luther
      publicly renounced communion with the Papacy, and burned the bull of Leo
      before the gates of Wittenberg, Protestantism attained its highest
      ascendency, an ascendency which it soon lost, and which it has never
      regained. Hundreds, who could well remember Brother Martin a devout
      Catholic, lived to see the revolution of which he was the chief author,
      victorious in half the states in Europe. In England, Scotland, Denmark,
      Sweden, Livonia, Prussia, Saxony, Hesse, Wurtemburg, the Palatinate, in
      several cantons of Switzerland, in the Northern Netherlands, the
      Reformation had completely triumphed; and in all the other countries on
      this side of the Alps and the Pyrenees, it seemed on the point of
      triumphing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while this mighty work was proceeding in the north of Europe, a
      revolution of a very different kind had taken place in the south. The
      temper of Italy and Spain was widely different from that of Germany and
      England. As the national feeling of the Teutonic nations impelled them to
      throw off the Italian supremacy, so the national feeling of the Italians
      impelled them to resist any change which might deprive their country of
      the honours and advantages which she enjoyed as the seat of the government
      of the Universal Church. It was in Italy that the tributes were spent of
      which foreign nations so bitterly complained. It was to adorn Italy that
      the traffic in Indulgences had been carried to that scandalous excess
      which had roused the indignation of Luther. There was among the Italians
      both much piety and much impiety: but, with very few exceptions, neither
      the piety nor the impiety took the turn of Protestantism. The religious
      Italians desired a reform of morals and discipline, but <span
      class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316" id="link316"></a>not a reform
      of doctrine, and least of all a schism. The irreligious Italians simply
      disbelieved Christianity, without hating it. They looked at it as artists
      or as statesmen; and, so looking at it, they liked it better in the
      established form than in any other. It was to them what the old Pagan
      worship was to Trajan and Pliny. Neither the spirit of Savonarola nor the
      spirit of Machiavelli had any thing in common with the spirit of the
      religious or political Protestants of the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spain again was, with respect to the Catholic Church, in a situation very
      different from that of the Teutonic nations. Italy was, in truth, a part
      of the empire of Charles the Fifth; and the court of Rome was, on many
      important occasions, his tool. He had not, therefore, like the distant
      princes of the North, a strong selfish motive for attacking the Papacy. In
      fact, the very measures which provoked the Sovereign of England to
      renounce all connection with Rome were dictated by the Sovereign of Spain.
      The feeling, of the Spanish people concurred with the interest of the
      Spanish government. The attachment of the Castilian to the faith of his
      ancestors was peculiarly strong and ardent. With that faith were
      inseparably bound up the institutions, the independence, and the glory of
      his countiy. Between the day when the last Gothic king was vanquished on
      the banks of the Xeres, and the day when Ferdinand and Isabella entered
      Granada in triumph, near eight hundred years had elapsed; and during those
      years the Spanish nation had been engaged in a desperate struggle against
      misbelievers. The Crusades had been merely an episode in the history of
      other nations. The existence of Spain had been one long Crusade. After
      fighting Mussulmans in the Old <span class="pagenum">317</span><a
      name="link317" id="link317"></a>World, she began to fight heathens in the
      New. It was under the authority of a Papal bull that her children steered
      into unknown seas. It was under the standard of the cross that they
      marched fearlessly into the heart of great kingdoms. It was with the cry
      of &ldquo;St. James for Spain,&rdquo; that they charged armies which outnumbered them
      a hundredfold. And men said that the Saint had heard the call, and had
      himself, in arms, on a gray war-horse, led the onset before which the
      worshippers of false gods had given way. After the battle, every excess of
      rapacity or cruelty was sufficiently vindicated by the plea that the
      sufferers were unbaptized. avarice stimulated zeal. Zeal consecrated
      avarice. Proselytes and gold mines were sought with equal ardour. In the
      very year in which the Saxons, maddened by the exactions of Rome, broke
      loose from her yoke, the Spaniards, under the authority of Rome, made
      themselves masters of the empire and of the treasures of Montezuma. Thus
      Catholicism which, in the public mind of Northern Europe, was associated
      with spoliation and oppression, was in the public mind of Spain associated
      with liberty, victory, dominion, wealth, and glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, therefore, strange that the effect of the great outbreak of
      Protestantism in one part of Christendom should have been to produce an
      equally violent outbreak of Catholic zeal in another. Two reformations
      were pushed on at once with equal energy and effect, a reformation of
      doctrine in the North, a reformation of manners and discipline in the
      South. In the course of a single generation, the whole spirit of the
      church of Rome underwent a change. From the halls of the Vatican to the
      most secluded hermitage of the Apennines, the great revival wad <span
      class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318" id="link318"></a>everywhere
      felt and seen. All the institutions anciently devised for the propagation
      and defence of the faith were furbished up and made efficient. Fresh
      engines of still more formidable power were constructed. Everywhere old
      religious communities were remodelled and new religious communities called
      into existence. Within a year after the death of Leo, the order of
      Camaldoli was purified. The Capuchins restored the old Franciscan
      discipline, the midnight prayer and the life of silence. The Barnabites
      and the society of Somasca devoted themselves to the relief and education
      of the poor. To the Theatine order a still higher interest belongs. Its
      great object was the same with that of our early Methodists, namely to
      supply the deficiencies of the parochial clergy. The Church of Rome, wiser
      than the Church of England, gave every countenance to the good work. The
      members of the new brotherhood preached to great multitudes in the streets
      and in the fields, prayed by the beds of the sick, and administered the
      last sacraments to the dying. Foremost among them in zeal and devotion was
      Gian Pietro Caraffa, afterwards Pope Paul the Fourth. In the convent of
      the Theatines at Venice, under the eye of Caraffa, a Spanish gentleman
      took up his abode, tended the poor in the hospitals, went about in rags,
      starved himself almost to death, and often sallied into the streets,
      mounted on stones, and, waving his hat to invite the passers-by, began to
      preach in a strange jargon of mingled Castilian and Tuscan. The Theatines
      were among the most zealous and rigid of men; but to this enthusiastic
      neophyte their discipline seemed lax, and their movements sluggish; for
      his own mind, naturally passionate and imaginative, had passed through a
      training which had given to all its peculiarities a morbid <span
      class="pagenum">319</span><a name="link319" id="link319"></a>intensity and
      energy. In his early life lie had been the very prototype of the hero of
      Cervantes. The single study of the young Hidalgo had been chivalrous
      romance; and his existence had been one gorgeous day-dream of princesses
      rescued and infidels subdued. He had chosen a Dulcinea, &ldquo;no countess, no
      duchess,&rdquo;&mdash;these are his own words,&mdash;but one of far higher
      station and he flattered himself with the hope of laying at her feet the
      keys of Moorish castles and the jewelled turbans of Asiatic kings. In the
      midst of these visions of martial glory and prosperous love, a severe
      wound stretched him on a bed of sickness. His constitution was shattered
      and he was doomed to be a cripple for life. The palm of strength, grace,
      and skill in knightly exercises, was no longer for him. He could no longer
      hope to strike down gigantic soldans, or to find favour in the sight of
      beautiful women. A new vision then arose in his mind, and mingled itself
      with his own delusions in a manner which to most Englishmen must seem
      singular, but which those who know how close was the union between
      religion and chivalry in Spain will be at no loss to understand. He would
      still be a soldier; he would still be a knight errant; but the soldier and
      knight errant of the spouse of Christ. He would smite the Great Red
      Dragon. He would be the champion of the Woman clothed with the Sun. He
      would break the charm under which false prophets held the souls of men in
      bondage. His restless spirit led him to the Syrian deserts, and to the
      chapel of the Holy Sepulchre. Thence he wandered back to the farthest
      West, and astonished the convents of Spain and the schools of France by
      his penances and vigils. The same lively imagination which had been
      employed in picturing the <span class="pagenum">320</span><a name="link320"
       id="link320"></a>tumult of unreal battles, and the charms of unreal
      queens, now peopled his solitude with saints and angels. The Holy Virgin
      descended to commune with him. He saw the Saviour face to face with the
      eye of flesh. Even those mysteries of religion which are the hardest trial
      of faith were in his case palpable to sight. It is difficult to relate
      without a pitying smile that, in the sacrifice of the mass, he saw
      transubstantiation take place, and that, as he stood praying on the steps
      of the Church of St. Dominic, he saw the Trinity in Unity, and wept aloud
      with joy and wonder. Such was the celebrated Ignatius Loyola, who, in the
      great Catholic reaction, bore the same part which Luther bore in the great
      Protestant movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dissatisfied with the system of the Theatines, the enthusiastic Spaniard
      turned his face towards Rome. Poor, obscure, without a patron, without
      recommendations, he entered the city where now two princely temples, rich
      with painting and many-coloured marble, commemorate his great services to
      the Church; where his form stands sculptured in massive silver; where his
      bones, enshrined amidst jewels, are placed beneath the altar of God. His
      activity and zeal bore down all opposition; and under his rule the order
      of Jesuits began to exist, and grew rapidly to the full measure of his
      gigantic powers. With what vehemence, with what policy, with what exact
      discipline, with what dauntless courage, with what self-denial, with what
      forgetfulness of the dearest private ties, with what intense and stubborn
      devotion to a single end, with what unscrupulous laxity and versatility in
      the choice of means, the Jesuits fought the battle of their church, is
      written in every page of the annals of Europe during several generations.
      In the order of Jesus was concentrated the <span class="pagenum">321</span><a
      name="link321" id="link321"></a>quintessence of the Catholic spirit; and
      the history of the order of Jesus is the history of the great Catholic
      reaction. That order possessed itself at once of all the strongholds which
      command the public mind, of the pulpit, of the press, of the confessional,
      of the academies. Wherever the Jesuit preached, the church was too small
      for the audience. The name of Jesuit on a title-page secured the
      circulation of a book. It was in the ears of the Jesuit that the powerful,
      the noble, and the beautiful, breathed the secret history of their lives.
      It was at the feet of the Jesuit that the youth of the higher and middle
      classes were brought up from childhood to manhood, from the&rsquo; first
      rudiments to the courses of rhetoric and philosophy. Literature and
      science, lately associated with infidelity or with heresy, now became the
      allies of orthodoxy. Dominant in the South of Europe, the great order soon
      went forth conquering and to conquer. In spite of oceans and deserts, of
      hunger and pestilence, of spies and penal laws, of dungeons and racks, of
      gibbets and quartering-blocks, Jesuits were to be found under every
      disguise, and in every country; scholars, physicians, merchants, serving
      men; in the hostile court of Sweden, in the old manor-house of Cheshire,
      among the hovels of Connaught; arguing, instructing, consoling, stealing
      away the hearts of the young, animating the courage of the timid, holding
      up the crucifix before the eyes of the dying. Nor was it less their office
      to plot against the thrones and lives of the apostate kings, to spread
      evil rumours, to raise tumults, to inflame civil wars, to arm the hand of
      the assassin. Inflexible in nothing but in their fidelity to the Church,
      they were equally ready to appeal in her cause to the spirit of loyalty
      and to the spirit of freedom. Extreme doctrines of obedience <span
      class="pagenum">322</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>and extreme
      doctrines of liberty, the right of rulers to misgovern the people, the
      right of every one of the people to plunge his knife in the heart of a bad
      ruler, were inculcated by the same man, according as he addressed himself
      to the subject of Philip or to the subject of Elizabeth. Some described
      these divines as the most rigid, others as the most indulgent of spiritual
      directors; and both descriptions were correct. The truly devout listened
      with awe to the high and saintly morality of the Jesuit. The gay cavalier
      who had run his rival through the body, the frail beauty who had forgotten
      her marriage-vow, found in the Jesuit an easy well-bred man of the world,
      who knew how to make allowance for the little irregularities of people of
      fashion. The confessor was strict or lax, according to the temper of the
      penitent. The first object was to drive no person out of the pale of the
      Church. Since there were bad people, it was better that they should be bad
      Catholics than bad Protestants. If a person was so unfortunate as to be a
      bravo, a libertine, or a gambler, that was no reason for making him a
      heretic too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old World was not wide enough for this strange activity. The Jesuits
      invaded all the countries which the great maritime discoveries of the
      preceding age had laid open to European enterprise. They were to be found
      in the depths of the Peruvian mines, at the marts of the African
      slave-caravans, on the shores of the Spice Islands, in the observatories
      of China. They made converts in regions which neither avarice nor
      curiosity had tempted any of their countrymen to enter; and preached and
      disputed in tongues of which no other native of the West understood a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit which appeared so eminently in this order animated the whole
      Catholic world. The Court of <span class="pagenum">323</span><a
      name="link323" id="link323"></a>Rome itself was purified. During the
      generation which preceded the Reformation, that court had been a scandal
      to the Christian name. Its annals are black with treason, murder, and
      incest. Even its more respectable members were utterly unfit to be
      ministers of religion. They were men like Leo the Tenth; men who, with the
      Latinity of the Augustan age, had acquired its atheistical and scoffing
      spirit. They regarded those Christian mysteries, of which they were
      stewards, just as the Augur Cicero and the high Pontiff Cæsar regarded the
      Sibylline books and the pecking of the sacred chickens. Among themselves,
      they spoke of the Incarnation, the Eucharist, and the Trinity, in the same
      tone in which Cotta and Velleius talked of the oracle of Delphi or the
      voice of Faunus in the mountains. Their years glided by in a soft dream of
      sensual and intellectual voluptuousness. Choice cookery, delicious wines,
      lovely women, hounds, falcons, horses, newly discovered manuscripts of the
      classics, sonnets and burlesque romances in the sweetest Tuscan, just as
      licentious as a fine sense of the graceful would permit, plate from the
      hand of Benvenuto, designs for palaces by Michael Angelo, frescoes by
      Raphael, busts, mosaics, and gems just dug up from among the ruins of
      ancient temples and villas, these things were the delight and even the
      serious business of their lives. Letters and the fine arts undoubtedly owe
      much to this not inelegant sloth. But when the great Stirling of the mind
      of Europe began, when doctrine after doctrine was assailed, when nation
      after nation withdrew from communion with the successor of St. Peter, it
      was felt that the Church could not be safely confided to chiefs whose
      highest praise was that they were good judges of Latin compositions, of
      <span class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a>paintings,
      and of statues, whose severest studies had a pagan character, and who were
      suspected of laughing in secret at the sacraments which they administered,
      and of believing no more of the Gospel than of the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>.
      Men of a very different class now rose to the direction of ecclesiastical
      affairs, men whose spirit resembled that of Dunstan and of Becket. The
      Roman Pontiffs exhibited in their own persons all the austerity of the
      early anchorites of Syria. Paul the Fourth brought to the Papal throne the
      same fervent zeal which had carried him into the Theatine convent. Pius
      the Fifth, under his gorgeous vestments, wore day and night the hair shirt
      of a simple friar, walked barefoot in the streets at the head of
      processions, found, even in the midst of his most pressing avocations,
      time for private prayer, often regretted that the public duties, of his
      station were unfavourable to growth of holiness, and edified his flock by
      innumerable instances of humility, charity, and forgiveness of personal
      injuries, while, at the same time, he upheld the authority of his see, and
      the unadulterated doctrines of his Church, with all the stubbornness and
      vehemence of Hildebrand. Gregory the Thirteenth exerted himself not only
      to imitate but to surpass Pius in the severe virtues of his sacred
      profession. As was the head, such were the members. The change in the
      spirit of the Catholic world may be traced in every walk of literature and
      of art. It will be at once perceived by every person who compares the poem
      of Tasso with that of Ariosto, or the monuments of Sixtus the Fifth with
      those of Leo the Tenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not on moral influence alone that the Catholic Church relied.
      The civil sword in Spain and Italy was unsparingly employed in her
      support. The <span class="pagenum">325</span><a name="link325" id="link325"></a>Inquisition
      was armed with new powers and inspired with a new energy. If
      Protestantism, or the semblance of Protestantism, showed itself in any
      quarter, it was instantly met, not by petty, teasing persecution, but by
      persecution of that sort which bows down and crashes all but a very few
      select spirits. Whoever was suspected of heresy, whatever his rank, his
      learning, or his reputation, knew that he must purge himself to the
      satisfaction of a severe and vigilant tribunal, or die by fire. Heretical
      books were sought out and destroyed with similar rigour. Works which were
      once in every house were so effectually suppressed that no copy of them is
      now to be found in the most extensive libraries. One book in particular,
      entitled &ldquo;Of the Benefits of the Death of Christ,&rdquo; had this fate. It was
      written in Tuscan, was many times reprinted, and was eagerly read in every
      part of Italy. But the inquisitors detected in it the Lutheran doctrine of
      justification by faith alone. They proscribed it; and it is now as
      hopelessly lost as the second decade of Livy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, while the Protestant reformation proceeded rapidly at one extremity
      of Europe, the Catholic revival went on as rapidly at the other. About
      half a century after the great separation, there were, throughout the
      North, Protestant governments and Protestant nations. In the South were
      governments and nations actuated by the most intense zeal for the ancient
      Church. Between these two hostile regions lay, morally as well as
      geographically, a great debatable land. In France, Belgium, Southern
      Germany, Hungary, and Poland, the contest was still undecided. The
      governments of those countries had not renounced their connection with
      Rome; but the Protestants were numerous, powerful, bold, and active. In
      France, they formed a commonwealth <span class="pagenum">326</span><a
      name="link326" id="link326"></a>within the realm, held fortresses, were
      able to bring great armies into the field, and had treated with their
      sovereign on terms of equality. In Poland, the King was still a Catholic;
      but the Protestants had the upper hand in the Diet, filled the chief
      offices in the administration, and, in the large towns, took possession of
      the parish churches. &ldquo;It appeared,&rdquo; says the Papal nuncio, &ldquo;that in
      Poland, Protestantism would completely supersede Catholicism.&rdquo; In Bavaria,
      the state of things was nearly the same. The Protestants had a majority in
      the Assembly of the States, and demanded from the duke concessions in
      favour of their religion, as the price of their subsidies. In
      Transylvania, the House of Austria was unable to prevent the Diet from
      confiscating, by one sweeping decree, the estates of the Church. In
      Austria Proper it was generally said that only one thirtieth part of the
      population could be counted on as good Catholics. In Belgium the adherents
      of the new opinions were reckoned by hundreds of thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the two succeeding generations is the history of the
      struggle between Protestantism possessed of the North of Europe, and
      Catholicism possessed of the South, for the doubtful territory which lay
      between. All the weapons of carnal and of spiritual warfare were employed.
      Both sides may boast of great talents and of great virtues. Both have to
      blush for many follies and crimes. At first the chances seemed to be
      decidedly in favour of Protestantism; but the victory remained with the
      Church of Rome. On every point she was successful. If we overleap another
      half century, we find her victorious and dominant in France, Belgium,
      Bavaria, Bohemia, Austria, Poland, and Hungary. Nor has Protestantism, in
      the course of two <span class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327"
       id="link327"></a>hundred years been able to reconquer any portion of what
      was then lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, moreover, not to be dissembled that this triumph of the Papacy is
      to be chiefly attributed, not to the force of arms, but to a great reflux
      in public opinion. During the first half century after the commencement of
      the Reformation, the current of feeling in the countries on this side of
      the Alps and of the Pyrenees ran impetuously towards the new doctrines.
      Then the tide turned, and rushed as fiercely in the opposite direction.
      Neither during the one period, nor during the other, did much depend upon
      the event of battles or sieges. The Protestant movement was hardly checked
      for an instant by the defeat at Muhlberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Catholic reaction went on at full speed in spite of the destruction of
      the Armada. It is difficult to say whether the violence of the first blow
      or of the recoil was the greater. Fifty years after the Lutheran
      separation, Catholicism could scarcely maintain itself on the shores of
      the Mediterranean. A hundred years after the separation, Protestantism
      could scarcely maintain itself on the shores of the Baltic. The causes of
      this memorable turn in human affairs well deserve to be investigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest between the two parties bore some resemblance to the
      fencing-match in Shakspeare; &ldquo;Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling,
      they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.&rdquo; The war between Luther
      and Leo was a war between firm faith and unbelief, between zeal and
      apathy, between energy and indolence, between seriousness and frivolity,
      between a pure morality and vice. Very different was the war which
      degenerate Protestantism had to wage against regenerate Catholicism. To
      the debauchee, <span class="pagenum">328</span><a name="link328"
       id="link328"></a>the poisoners, the atheists, who had worn the tiara
      during the generation which preceded the Reformation, had succeeded Popes
      who, in religious fervour and severe sanctity of manners, might bear a
      comparison with Cyprian or Ambrose. The order of Jesuits alone could show
      many men not inferior in sincerity, constancy, courage, and austerity of
      life, to the apostles of the Reformation. But while danger had thus called
      forth in the bosoms of the Church of Rome many of the highest qualities of
      the Reformers, the Reformers had contracted some of the corruptions which
      had been justly censured in the Church of Rome. They had become lukewarm
      and worldly. Their great old leaders had been borne to the grave, and had
      left no successors. Among the Protestant princes there was little or no
      hearty Protestant feeling. Elizabeth herself was a Protestant rather from
      policy than from firm conviction. James the First, in order to effect his
      favourite object of marrying his son into one of the great continental
      houses, was ready to make immense concessions to Rome, and even to admit a
      modified primacy in the Pope. Henry the Fourth twice abjured the reformed
      doctrines from interested motives. The Elector of Saxony, the natural head
      of the Protestant party in Germany, submitted to become, at the most
      important crisis of the struggle, a tool in the hands of the Papists.
      Among the Catholic sovereigns, on the other hand, we find a religious zeal
      often amounting to fanaticism. Philip the Second was a Papist in a very
      different sense from that in which Elizabeth was a Protestant. Maximilian
      of Bavaria, brought up under the teaching of the Jesuits, was a fervent
      missionary wielding the powers of a prince. The Emperor Ferdinand the
      Second deliberately put <span class="pagenum">329</span><a name="link329"
       id="link329"></a>his throne to hazard over and over again, rather than
      make the smallest concession to the spirit of religious innovation.
      Sigismund of Sweden lost a crown which he might have preserved if he would
      have renounced the Catholic faith. In short, everywhere on the Protestant
      side we see languor; everywhere on the Catholic side we see ardour and
      devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was there, at this time, a much more intense zeal among the
      Catholics than among the Protestants; but the whole zeal of the Catholics
      was directed against the Protestants, while almost the whole zeal of the
      Protestants was directed against each other. Within the Catholic Church
      there were no serious disputes on points of doctrine. The decisions of the
      Council of Trent were received; and the Jansenian controversy had not yet
      arisen. The whole force of Rome was, therefore, effective for the purpose
      of carrying on the war against the Reformation. On the other hand, the
      force which ought to have fought the battle of the Reformation was
      exhausted in civil conflict. While Jesuit preachers, Jesuit confessors,
      Jesuit teachers of youth, overspread Europe, eager to expend every faculty
      of their minds and every drop of their blood in the cause of their Church,
      Protestant doctors were confuting, and Protestant rulers were punishing,
      sectaries who were just as good Protestants as themselves. <br /><br /><span

    <p>
      In the Palatinate, a Calvinistic prince persecuted the Lutherans. In
      Saxony, a Lutheran prince persecuted the Calvinists. Everybody who
      objected to any of the articles of the Confession of Augsburg was banished
      from Sweden. In Scotland, Melville was <span class="pagenum">330</span><a
      name="link330" id="link330"></a>disputing with other Protestants on
      questions of ecclesiastical government. In England the gaols were filled
      with men, who, though zealous for the Reformation, did not exactly agree
      with the Court on all points of discipline and doctrine. Some were
      persecuted for denying the tenet of reprobation; some for not wearing
      surplices. The Irish people might at that time have been, in all
      probability, reclaimed from Popery, at the expense of half the zeal and
      activity which Whitgift employed in oppressing Puritans, and Martin
      Marprelate in reviling bishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Catholics in zeal and in union had a great advantage over the
      Protestants, so had they also an infinitely superior organization. In
      truth, Protestantism, for aggressive purposes, had no organization at all.
      The Reformed Churches, were mere national Churches. The Church of England
      existed for England alone. It was an institution as purely local as the
      Court of Common Pleas, and was utterly without any machinery for foreign
      operations. The Church of Scotland, in the same manner, existed for
      Scotland alone. The operations of the Catholic Church, on the other hand,
      took in the whole world. Nobody at Lambeth or at Edinburgh troubled
      himself about what was doing in Poland or Bavaria. But Cracow and Munich
      were at Rome objects of as much interest as the purlieus of St. John
      Lateran. Our island, the head of the Protestant interest, did not send out
      a single missionary or a single instructor of youth to the scene of the
      great spiritual war. Not a single seminary was established here for the
      purpose of furnishing a supply of such persons to foreign countries. On
      the other hand, Germany, Hungary, and Poland were filled with able and
      active Catholic emissaries of Spanish or Italian birth; and <span
      class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a>colleges for
      the instruction of the northern youth were founded at Rome. The spiritual
      force of Protestantism was a mere local militia, which might be useful in
      case of an invasion, but could not be sent abroad, and could therefore
      make no conquests. Rome had such a local militia; but she had also a force
      disposable at a moment&rsquo;s notice for foreign service, however dangerous or
      disagreeable. If it was thought at head-quarters that a Jesuit at Palermo
      was qualified by his talents and character to withstand the Reformers in
      Lithuania, the order was instantly given and instantly obeyed. In a month,
      the faithful servant of the Church was preaching, catechising, confessing,
      beyond the Niemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to deny that the polity of the Church of Rome is the very
      master-piece of human wisdom. In truth, nothing but such a polity could,
      against such assaults, have borne up such doctrines. The experience of
      twelve hundred eventful years, the ingenuity and patient care of forty
      generations of statesmen, have improved that polity to such perfection
      that, among the contrivances which have been devised for deceiving and
      oppressing mankind it occupies the highest place. The stronger our
      conviction that reason and scripture were decidedly on the side of
      Protestantism, the greater is the reluctant admiration with which we
      regard that system of tactics against which reason and scripture were
      employed in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we went at large into this most interesting subject we should fill
      volumes. We will, therefore, at present, advert to only one important part
      of the policy of the Church of Rome. She thoroughly understands, what no
      other Church has ever understood, how to deal with enthusiasts. In some
      sects, particularly in infant sects, enthusiasm is suffered to be rampant.
      In other sects, <span class="pagenum">332</span><a name="link332"
       id="link332"></a>particularly in sects long established and richly
      endowed, it is regarded with aversion. The Catholic Church neither submits
      to enthusiasm nor proscribes it, but uses it. She considers it as a great
      moving force which in itself, like the muscular power of a fine horse, is
      neither good nor evil, but which may be so directed as to produce great
      good or great evil; and she assumes the direction to herself. It would be
      absurd to run down a horse like a wolf. It would be still more absurd to
      let him run wild, breaking fences and trampling down passengers. The
      rational course is to subjugate his will without impairing his vigour, to
      teach him to obey the rein and then to urge him to full speed. When once
      he knows his master, he is valuable in proportion to his strength and
      spirit. Just such has been the system of the Church of Rome with regard to
      enthusiasts. She knows that, when religious feelings have obtained the
      complete&rsquo; empire of the mind, they impart a strange energy, that they
      raise men above the dominion of pain and pleasure, that obloquy becomes
      glory, that death itself is contemplated only as the beginning of a higher
      and happier life. She knows that a person in this state is no object of
      contempt. He may be vulgar, ignorant, visionary, extravagant; but he will
      do and suffer things which it is for her interest that somebody should do
      and suffer, yet from which calm and sober-minded men would shrink. She
      accordingly enlists him in her service, assigns to him some forlorn hope,
      in which intrepidity and impetuosity are more wanted than judgment and
      self-command, and sends him forth with her benediction and her applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England it not unfrequently happens that a tinker or coalheaver hears a
      sermon or falls in with a tract which alarms him about the state of his
      soul. If he be a <span class="pagenum">333</span><a name="link333"
       id="link333"></a>man of excitable nerves and strong imagination, he thinks
      himself given over to the Evil Power. He doubts whether he has not
      committed the unpardonable sin. He imputes every wild fancy that springs
      up in his mind to the whisper of a fiend. His sleep is broken by dreams of
      the great judgment seat, the open books, and the unquenchable fire. If, in
      order to escape from these vexing thoughts, he flies to amusement or to
      licentious indulgence, the delusive relief only makes his misery darker
      and more hopeless. At length a turn takes place. He is reconciled to his
      offended Maker. To borrow the fine imagery of one who had himself been
      thus tried, he emerges from the Valley of the Shadow of death, from the
      dark land of gins and snares, of quagmires and precipices, of evil spirits
      and ravenous beasts. The sunshine is on his path. He ascends the
      Delectable Mountains, and catches from their summit a distant view of the
      shining city which is the end of his pilgrimage. Then arises in his mind a
      natural and surely not a censurable desire, to impart to others the
      thoughts of which his own heart is full, to warn the careless, to comfort
      those who are troubled in spirit. The impulse which urges him to devote
      his whole life to the teaching of religion is a strong passion in the
      guise of a duty. He exhorts his neighbours; and, if he be a man of strong
      parts, he often does so with great effect. He pleads as if he were
      pleading for his life, with tears, and pathetic gestures, and burning
      words; and he soon finds with delight, not perhaps wholly unmixed with the
      alloy of human infirmity, that his rude eloquence rouses and melts hearers
      who sleep very composedly while the rector preaches on the apostolical
      succession. Zeal for God, love for his fellow-creatures, pleasure in the
      exercise of his newly discovered powers, <span class="pagenum">334</span><a
      name="link334" id="link334"></a>impel him to become a preacher. He has no
      quarrel with the establishment, no objection to its formularies, its
      government, or its vestments. He would gladly be admitted among its
      humblest ministers. But, admitted or rejected, he feels that his vocation
      is determined. His orders have come down to him, not through a long and
      doubtful series of Arian and Popish bishops, but direct from on high. His
      commission is the same that, on the Mountain of Ascension was given to the
      Eleven. Nor will he, for lack of human credentials, spare to deliver the
      glorious message with which he is charged by the true Head of the Church.
      For a man thus minded, there is within the pale of the establishment no
      place. He has been at no college; he cannot construe a Greek author or
      write a Latin theme; and he is told that, if he remains in the communion
      of the Church, he must do so as a hearer, and that, if he is resolved to
      be a teacher, he must begin by being a schismatic. His choice is soon
      made. He harangues on Tower Hill or in Smithfield. A congregation is
      formed. A license is obtained. A plain brick building, with a desk and
      benches, is run up, and named Ebenezer or Bethel. In a few weeks the
      Church has lost for ever a hundred families, not one of which entertained
      the least scruple about her articles, her liturgy, her government, or her
      ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far different is the policy of Rome. The ignorant enthusiast whom the
      Anglican Church makes an enemy, and, whatever the polite and learned may
      think, a most dangerous enemy, the Catholic Church makes a champion. She
      bids him nurse his beard, covers him with a gown and hood of coarse dark
      stuff, ties a rope round his waist, and sends him forth to teach in her
      name. He costs her nothing. He takes not a ducat <span class="pagenum">335</span><a
      name="link335" id="link335"></a>away from the revenues of her beneficed
      clergy. He lives by the alms of those who respect his spiritual character,
      and are grateful for his instructions. He preaches, not exactly in the
      style of Massillon, but in a way which moves the passions of uneducated
      hearers; and all his influence is employed to strengthen the Church of
      which he is a minister. To that Church he becomes as strongly attached as
      any of the cardinals whose scarlet carriages and liveries crowd the
      entrance of the palace on the Quirinal. In this way the Church of Rome
      unites in herself all the strength of establishment, and all the strength
      of dissent. With the utmost pomp of a dominant hierarchy above, she has
      all the energy of the voluntary system below. It would be easy to mention
      very recent instances in which the hearts of hundreds of thousands,
      estranged from her by the selfishness, sloth, and cowardice of the
      beneficed clergy, have been brought back by the zeal of the begging
      friars.

    <p>
      Even for female agency there is a place in her system. To devout women she
      assigns spiritual functions, dignities, and magistracies. In our country,
      if a noble lady is moved by more than ordinary zeal for the propagation of
      religion, the chance is that, though she may disapprove of no doctrine or
      ceremony of the Established Church, she will end by giving her name to a
      new schism. If a pious and benevolent woman enters the cells of a prison
      to pray with the most unhappy and degraded of her own sex, she does so
      without any authority from the Church. No line of action is traced out for
      her; and it is well if the Ordinary does not complain of her intrusion,
      and if the Bishop does not shake his head at such irregular benevolence.
      At Rome, the Countess of Huntingdon would have a place in <span
      class="pagenum">336</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>the calendar
      as St. Selina, and Mrs. Fry would be foundress and first Superior of the
      Blessed Order of Sisters of the Gaols.

      Place Ignatius Loyola at Oxford. He is certain to become the head of a
      formidable secession. Place John Wesley at Rome. He is certain to be the
      first General of a new society devoted to the interests and honour of the
      Church. Place St. Theresa in London. Her restless enthusiasm ferments into
      madness, not untinctured with craft. She becomes the prophetess, the
      mother of the faithful, holds disputations with the devil, issues sealed
      pardons to her adorers, and lies in of the Shiloh. Place Joanna Southcote
      at Rome. She founds an order of barefooted Carmelites, every one of whom
      is ready to suffer martyrdom for the Church; a solemn service is
      consecrated to her memory; and her statue, placed over the holy water,
      strikes the eye of every stranger who enters St. Peter&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have dwelt long on this subject, because we believe that of the many
      causes to which the Church of Rome owed her safety and her triumph at the
      close of the sixteenth century, the chief was the profound policy with
      which she used the fanaticism of such persons as St Ignatius and St.
      Theresa.

    <p>
      The Protestant party was now indeed vanquished and humbled. In France so
      strong had been the Catholic reaction that Henry the Fourth found it
      necessary to choose between his religion and his crown. In spite of his
      clear hereditary right, in spite of his eminent personal qualities, he saw
      that, unless he reconciled himself to the Church of Rome, he could not
      count on the fidelity even of those gallant gentlemen whose impetuous
      valour had turned the tide of battle at Ivry. In Belgium, Poland, and
      Southern Germany, Catholicism <span class="pagenum">337</span><a
      name="link337" id="link337"></a>had obtained complete ascendency. The
      resistance of Bohemia was put down. The Palatinate was conquered. Upper
      and Lower Saxony were overflowed by Catholic invaders. The King of Denmark
      stood forth as the Protector of the Reformed Churches: he was defeated,
      driven out of the empire, and attacked in his own possessions. The armies
      of the House of Austria pressed on, subjugated Pomerania, and were stopped
      in their progress only by the ramparts of Stralsund.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now again the tide turned. Two violent outbreaks of religious feeling
      in opposite directions had given a character to the history of a whole
      century. Protestantism had at first driven back Catholicism to the Alps
      and the Pyrenees. Catholicism had rallied, and had driven back
      Protestantism even to the German Ocean. Then the great southern reaction
      began to slacken, as the great northern movement had slackened before. The
      zeal of the Catholics waxed cool. Their union was dissolved. The paroxysm
      of religious excitement was over on both sides. One party had degenerated
      as far from the spirit of Loyola as the other from the spirit of Luther.
      During three generations religion had been the mainspring of politics. The
      revolutions and civil wars of France, Scotland, Holland, Sweden, the long
      struggle between Philip and Elizabeth, the bloody competition for the
      Bohemian crown, had all originated in theological disputes. But a great
      change now took place. The contest which was raging in Germany lost its
      religious character. It was now, on one side, less a contest for the
      spiritual ascendency of the Church of Rome than for the temporal
      ascendency of the House of Austria. On the other side, it was less a
      contest for the reformed doctrines than for <span class="pagenum">338</span><a
      name="link338" id="link338"></a>national independence. Governments began
      to form themselves into new combinations, in which community of political
      interest was far more regarded than community of religious belief. Even at
      Rome the progress of the Catholic arms was observed with mixed feelings.
      The Supreme Pontiff was a sovereign prince of the second rank, and was
      anxious about the balance of power as well as about the propagation of
      truth. It was known that he dreaded the rise of an universal monarchy even
      more than he desired the prosperity of the Universal Church. At length a
      great event announced to the world that the war of sects bad ceased, and
      that the war of states had succeeded. A coalition, including Calvinists,
      Lutherans, and Catholics, was formed against the House of Austria. At the
      head of that coalition were the first statesman and the first warrior of
      the age; the former a prince of the Catholic Church, distinguished by the
      vigour and success with which he had put down the Huguenots; the latter a
      Protestant king, who owed his throne to a revolution caused by hatred of
      Popery. The alliance of Richelieu and Gustavus marks the time at which the
      great religious struggle terminated. The war which followed was a war for
      the equilibrium of Europe. When, at length, the peace of Westphalia was
      concluded, it appeared that the Church of Rome remained in full possession
      of a vast dominion, which in the middle of the preceding century she
      seemed to be on the point of losing. No part of Europe remained
      Protestant, except that part which had become thoroughly Protestant before
      the generation which heard Luther preach had passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that time there has been no religious war between Catholics and
      Protestants as such. In the time <span class="pagenum">339</span><a
      name="link339" id="link339"></a>of Cromwell, Protestant England was united
      with Catholic France, then governed by a priest, against Catholic Spain.
      William the Third, the eminently Protestant hero, was at the head of a
      coalition which included many Catholic powers, and which was secretly
      favoured even by Rome, against the Catholic Lewis. In the time of Anne,
      Protestant England and Protestant Holland joined with Catholic Savoy and
      Catholic Portugal, for the purpose of transferring the crown of Spain from
      one bigoted Catholic to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geographical frontier between the two religions has continued to run
      almost precisely where it ran at the close of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War; nor
      has Protestantism given any proofs of that &ldquo;expansive power&rdquo; which has
      been ascribed to it. But the Protestant boasts, and boasts most justly,
      that wealth, civilisation, and intelligence, have increased far more on
      the northern than on the southern side of the boundary, and that countries
      so little favoured by nature as Scotland and Prussia are now among the
      most flourishing and best governed portions of the world, while the marble
      palaces of Genoa are deserted, while banditti infest the beautiful shores
      of Campania, while the fertile sea-coast of the Pontifical State is
      abandoned to buffaloes and wild boars. It cannot be doubted that, since
      the sixteenth century, the Protestant nations have made decidedly greater
      progress than their neighbours. The progress made by those nations in
      which Protestantism, though not finally successful, yet maintained a long
      struggle, and left permanent traces, has generally been considerable. But
      when we come to the Catholic Land, to the part of Europe in which the
      first spark of reformation was trodden out as soon as it appeared, and
      from which proceeded the impulse which drove <span class="pagenum">340</span><a
      name="link340" id="link340"></a>Protestantism back, we find, at best, a
      very slow progress, and on the whole a retrogression. Compare Denmark and
      Portugal. When Luther began to preach, the superiority of the Portuguese
      was unquestionable. At present, the superiority of the Danes is no less
      so. Compare Edinburgh and Florence. Edinburgh has owed less to climate, to
      soil, and to the fostering care of rulers than any capital, Protestant or
      Catholic. In all these respects, Florence has been singularly happy. Yet
      whoever knows what Florence and Edinburgh were in the generation preceding
      the Reformation, and what they are now, will acknowledge that some great
      cause has, during the last three centuries, operated to raise one part of
      the European family, and to depress the other. Compare the history of
      England and that of Spain during the last century. In arms, arts,
      sciences, letters, commerce, agriculture, the contrast is most striking.
      The distinction is not confined to this side of the Atlantic. The colonies
      planted by England in America have immeasurably outgrown in power those
      planted by Spain. Yet we have no reason to believe that, at the beginning
      of the sixteenth century, the Castilian was in any respect inferior to the
      Englishman. Our firm belief is, that the North owes its great civilisation
      and prosperity chiefly to the moral, effect of the Protestant Reformation,
      and that the decay of the Southern countries of Europe is to be mainly
      ascribed to the great Catholic revival.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a hundred years after the final settlement of the boundary line
      between Protestantism and Catholicism, began to appear the signs of the
      fourth great peril of the Church of Rome. The storm which was now rising
      against her was of a very different kind from those which had preceded it.
      Those who had formerly <span class="pagenum">341</span><a name="link341"
       id="link341"></a>attacked her had questioned only a part of her doctrines.
      A school was now growing up which rejected the whole. The Albigenses, the
      Lollards, the Lutherans, the Calvinists, had a positive religious system,
      and were strongly attached to it. The creed of the new sectaries was
      altogether negative. They took one of their premises from the Protestants,
      and one from the Catholics. From the latter they borrowed the principle,
      that Catholicism was the only pure and genuine Christianity. With the
      former, they held that some parts of the Catholic system were contrary to
      reason. The conclusion was obvious. Two propositions, each of which
      separately is compatible with the most exalted piety, formed, when held in
      conjunction, the groundwork of a system of irreligion. The doctrine of
      Bossuet, that transubstantiation is affirmed in the Gospel, and the
      doctrine of Tillotson, that transubstantiation is an absurdity, when put
      together, produced by logical necessity the inferences of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the sect which was rising at Paris been a sect of mere scoffers, it is
      very improbable that it would have left deep traces of its existence in
      the institutions and manners of Europe. Mere negation, mere Epicurean
      infidelity, as Lord Bacon most justly observes, has never disturbed the
      peace of the world. It furnishes no motive for action. It inspires no
      enthusiasm. It has no missionaries, no crusaders, no martyrs. If the
      Patriarch of the Holy Philosophical Church had contented himself with
      making jokes about Saul&rsquo;s asses and David&rsquo;s wives, and with criticizing
      the poetry of Ezekiel in the same narrow spirit in which he criticized
      that of Shakspeare, Rome would have had little to fear. But it is due to
      him and to his compeers to say that the real secret of their strength lay
      in the truth which <span class="pagenum">342</span><a name="link342"
       id="link342"></a>was mingled with their errors, and in the generous
      enthusiasm which was hidden under their flippancy. They were men who, with
      all their faults, moral and intellectual, sincerely and earnestly desired
      the improvement of the condition of the human race, whose blood boiled at
      the sight of cruelty and injustice, who made manful war, with every
      faculty which they possessed, on what they considered as abuses, and who
      on many signal occasions placed themselves gallantly between the powerful
      and the oppressed. While they assailed Christianity with a rancour and an
      unfairness disgraceful to men who called themselves philosophers, they yet
      had, in far greater measure than their opponents, that charity towards men
      of all classes and races which Christianity enjoins. Religious
      persecution, judicial torture, arbitrary imprisonment, the unnecessary
      multiplication of capital punishments, the delay and chicanery of
      tribunals, the exactions of farmers of the revenue, slavery, the slave
      trade, were the constant subjects of their lively satire and eloquent
      disquisitions. When an innocent man was broken on the wheel at Toulouse,
      when a youth, guilty only of an indiscretion, was beheaded at Abbeville,
      when a brave officer, borne down by public injustice, was dragged, with a
      gag in his mouth, to die on the Place de Grève, a voice instantly went
      forth from the banks of Lake Leman, which made itself heard from Moscow to
      Cadiz, and which sentenced the unjust judges to the contempt and
      detestation of all Europe. The really efficient weapons with which the
      philosophers assailed the evangelical faith were borrowed from the
      evangelical morality. The ethical and dogmatical parts of the Gospel were
      unhappily turned against each other. On one side was a Church boasting of
      the purity of a doctrine derived from the Apostles, but disgraced <span
      class="pagenum">343</span><a name="link343" id="link343"></a>by the
      massacre of St. Bartholomew, by the murder of the best of kings, by the
      war of Cevennes, by the destruction of Port-Royal. On the other side was a
      sect laughing at the Scriptures, shooting out the tongue at the
      sacraments, but ready to encounter principalities and powers in the cause
      of justice, mercy, and toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irreligion, accidentally associated with philanthropy, triumphed for a
      time over religion accidentally associated with political and social
      abuses. Every thing gave way to the zeal and activity of the new
      reformers. In France, every man distinguished in letters was found in
      their ranks. Every year gave birth to works in which the fundamental
      principles of the Church were attacked with argument, invective, and
      ridicule. The Church made no defence, except by acts of power. Censures
      were pronounced: books were seized: insults were offered to the remains of
      infidel writers; but no Bossuet, no Pascal, came forth to encounter
      Voltaire. There appeared not a single defence of the Catholic doctrine
      which produced any considerable effect, or which is now even remembered. A
      bloody and unsparing persecution, like that which put down the Albigenses,
      might have put down the philosophers. But the time for De Montforts and
      Dominies had gone by. The punishments which the priests were still able to
      inflict were sufficient to irritate, but not sufficient to destroy. The
      war was between power on one side, and wit on the other; and the power was
      under far more restraint than the wit. Orthodoxy soon became a synonyme
      for ignorance and stupidity. It was as necessary to the character of an
      accomplished man that he should despise the religion of his country, as
      that he should know his letters. The new doctrines spread <span
      class="pagenum">344</span><a name="link344" id="link344"></a>rapidly
      through Christendom. Paris was the capital of the whole continent. French
      was everywhere the language of polite circles. The literary glory of Italy
      and Spain had departed. That of Germany had not dawned. That of England
      shone, as yet, for the English alone. The teachers of France were the
      teachers of Europe. The Parisian opinions spread fast among the educated
      classes beyond the Alps: nor could the vigilance of the Inquisition
      prevent the contraband importation of the new heresy into Castile and
      Portugal. Governments, even arbitrary governments, saw with pleasure the
      progress of this philosophy. Numerous reforms, generally laudable,
      sometimes hurried on without sufficient regard to time, to place, and to
      public feeling, showed the extent of its influence. The rulers of Prussia,
      of Russia, of Austria, and of many smaller states, were supposed to be
      among the initiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church of Rome was still, in outward show, as stately and splendid as
      ever; but her foundation was undermined. No state had quitted her
      communion or confiscated her revenues; but the reverence of the people was
      everywhere departing from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first great warning stroke was the fall of that society which, in the
      conflict with Protestantism, had saved the Catholic Church from
      destruction. The order of Jesus had never recovered from the injury
      received in the struggle with Port-Royal. It was now still more rudely
      assailed by the philosophers. Its spirit was broken; its reputation was
      tainted. Insulted by all the men of genius in Europe, condemned by the
      civil, magistrate, feebly defended by the chiefs of the hierarchy, it
      fell: and great, was the fall of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement went on with increasing speed. The first generation of the
      new sect passed away. The <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345"
       id="link345"></a>doctrines of Voltaire were inherited and exaggerated by
      successors, who bore to him the same relation which the Anabaptists bore
      to Luther, or the Fifth-Monarchy men to Pym. At length the Revolution
      came. Down went the old Church of France, with all its pomp and wealth.
      Some of its priests purchased a maintenance by separating themselves from
      Rome, and by becoming the authors of a fresh schism. Some, rejoicing in
      the new license, flung away their sacred vestments, proclaimed that their
      whole life had been an imposture, insulted and persecuted the religion of
      which they had been ministers, and distinguished themselves, even in the
      Jacobin Club and the Commune of Paris, by the excess of their impudence
      and ferocity. Others, more faithful to their principles, were butchered by
      scores without a trial, drowned, shot, hung on lamp-posts. Thousands fled
      from their country to take sanctuary under the shade of hostile altars.
      The churches were closed; the bells were silent; the shrines were
      plundered; the silver crucifixes were melted down. Buffoons, dressed in
      copes and surplices, came dancing the <i>carmagnole</i> even to the bar of
      the Convention. The bust of Marat was substituted for the statues of the
      martyrs of Christianity. A prostitute, seated on a chair of state in the
      chancel of Nôtre Dame, received the adoration of thousands, who exclaimed
      that at length, for the first time, those ancient Gothic arches had
      resounded with the accents of truth. The new unbelief was as intolerant as
      the old superstition. To show reverence for religion was to incur the
      suspicion of disaffection. It was not without imminent danger that the
      priest baptized the infant, joined the hands of lovers, or listened to the
      confession of the dying. The absurd worship of the Goddess of Reason was,
      indeed, <span class="pagenum">346</span><a name="link346" id="link346"></a>of
      short duration; but the deism of Robespierre and Lepaux was not less
      hostile to the Catholic faith than the atheism of Clootz and Chaumette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the calamities of the Church confined to France. The
      revolutionary spirit, attacked by all Europe, beat all Europe back, became
      conqueror in its turn, and, not satisfied with the Belgian cities and the
      rich domains of the spiritual electors, went raging over the Rhine and
      through the passes of the Alps. Throughout the whole of the great war
      against Protestantism, Italy and Spain had been the base of the Catholic
      operations. Spain was now the obsequious vassal of the infidels. Italy was
      subjugated by them. To her ancient principalities succeeded the Cisalpine
      republic, and the Ligurian republic, and the Parthenopean republic. The
      shrine of Loretto was stripped of the treasures piled up by the devotion
      of six hundred years. The convents of Rome were pillaged. The tricoloured
      flag floated on the top of the Castle of St. Angelo. The successor of St.
      Peter Was carried away captive by the unbelievers. He died a prisoner in
      their hands; and even the honours of sepulture were long withheld from his
      remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not strange that, in the year 1799, even sagacious observers should
      have thought that, at length, the hour of the Church of Rome was come. An
      infidel power ascendant, the Pope dying in captivity, the most illustrious
      prelates of France living in a foreign country on Protestant alms, the
      noblest edifices which-the munificence of former ages had consecrated to
      the worship of God turned into temples of Victory, or into
      banqueting-houses for political societies, or into Theophilanthropic
      chapels, such signs might well be supposed to indicate the approaching end
      of that long domination. <span class="pagenum">347</span><a name="link347"
       id="link347"></a>But the end was not yet. Again doomed to death, the
      milk-white hind was still fated not to die. Even before the funeral rites
      had been performed over the ashes of Pius the Sixth, a great reaction had
      commenced, which, after the lapse of more than forty years, appears to be
      still in progress. Anarchy had had its day. A new order of things rose out
      of the confusion, new dynasties, new laws, new titles; and amidst them
      emerged the ancient religion. The Arabs have a fable that the Great
      Pyramid was built by antediluvian kings, and alone, of all the works of
      men, bore the weight of the flood. Such as this was the fate of the
      Papacy. It had been buried under the great inundation; but its deep
      foundations had remained unshaken; and, when the waters abated, it
      appeared alone amidst the ruins of a world which had passed away. The
      republic of Holland was gone, and the empire of Germany, and the great
      Council of Venice, and the old Helvetian League, and the House of Bourbon,
      and the parliaments and aristocracy of France. Europe was full of young
      creations, a French empire, a kingdom of Italy, a Confederation of the
      Rhine. Nor had the late events affected only territorial limits and
      political institutions. The distribution of property, the composition and
      spirit of society, had, through great part of Catholic Europe, undergone a
      complete change. But the unchangeable Church was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some future historian, as able and temperate as Professor Ranke, will, we
      hope, trace the progress of the Catholic revival of the nineteenth
      century. We feel that we are drawing too near our own time, and that, if
      we go on we shall be in danger of saying much which may be supposed to
      indicate, and which will certainly excite angry feelings. We will,
      therefore, make only <span class="pagenum">348</span><a name="link348"
       id="link348"></a>one more observation, which, in our opinion, is deserving
      of serious attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the eighteenth century, the influence of the Church of Rome was
      constantly on the decline. Unbelief made extensive conquests in all the
      Catholic countries of Europe, and in some countries obtained a complete
      ascendency. The Papacy was at length brought so low as to be an object of
      derision to infidels, and of pity rather than of hatred to Protestants.
      During the nineteenth century, this fallen Church has been gradually
      rising from her depressed state and reconquering her old dominion. No
      person who calmly reflects on what, within the last few years, has passed
      in Spain, in Italy, in South America, in Ireland, in the Netherlands, in
      Prussia, even in France, can doubt that the power of this Church over the
      hearts and minds of men, is now greater far than it was when the
      Encyclopaedia and the Philosophical Dictionary appeared. It is surely
      remarkable, that neither the moral revolution of the eighteenth century,
      nor the moral counter-revolution of the nineteenth, should, in any
      perceptible degree, have added to the domain of Protestantism. During the
      former period, whatever was lost to Catholicism was lost also to
      Christianity; during the latter, whatever was regained by Christianity in
      Catholic countries was regained also by Catholicism. We should naturally
      have expected that many minds, on the way from superstition to infidelity,
      or on the way back from infidelity to superstition, would have stopped at
      an intermediate point. Between the doctrines taught in the schools of the
      Jesuits, and those which were maintained at the little supper parties of
      the Baron Holbach, there is a vast interval, in which the human mind, it
      should seem, might find for itself some resting-place more satisfactory
      <span class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349" id="link349"></a>than
      either of the two extremes. And at the time of the Reformation, millions
      found such a resting-place. Whole nations then renounced Popery without
      ceasing to believe in a first cause, in a future life, or in the Divine
      mission of Jesus. In the last century, on the other hand, when a Catholic
      renounced his belief in the real presence, it was a thousand to one that
      he renounced his belief in the Gospel too; and, when the reaction took
      place, with belief in the Gospel came back belief in the real presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We by no means venture to deduce from these phænomena any general law; but
      we think it a most remarkable fact, that no Christian nation, which did
      not adopt the principles of the Reformation before the end of the
      sixteenth century, should ever have adopted them. Catholic communities
      have, since that time, become infidel and become Catholic again; but none
      has become Protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we close this hasty sketch of one of the most important portions of
      the history of mankind. Our readers will have great reason to feel obliged
      to us if we have interested them sufficiently to induce them to peruse
      Professor Ranke&rsquo;s book. We will only caution them against the French
      translation, a performance which, in our opinion, is just as discreditable
      to the moral character of the person from whom it proceeds as a false
      affidavit or a forged bill of exchange would have been, and advise them to
      study either the original, or the English version, in which the sense and
      spirit of the original are admirably preserved.

      LEIGH HUNT. (1)

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">350</span><a name="link350" id="link350"></a>have a
      kindness for Mr. Leigh Hunt. We form our judgment of him, indeed, only
      from events of universal notoriety, from his own works and from the works
      of other writers, who have generally abused him in the most rancorous
      manner. But, unless we are greatly mistaken, he is a very clever, a very
      honest, and a very good-natured man. We can clearly discern, together with
      many merits, many faults both in his writings and in his conduct. But we
      really think that there is hardly a man living whose merits have been so
      grudgingly allowed, and whose faults have been so cruelly expiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some respects Mr. Leigh Hunt is excellently qualified for the task
      which he has now undertaken. His style, in spite of its mannerism, nay,
      partly by reason of its mannerism, is well suited for light, garrulous,
      desultory <i>ana</i>, half critical, half biographical. We do not always
      agree with his literary judgments; but we find in him what is very rare in
      our time, the power of justly appreciating and heartily enjoying good
      things of very different kinds. He can adore Shakspeare and Spenser
      without denying poetical

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">351</span><a name="link351" id="link351"></a>genius
      to the author of Alexander&rsquo;s Feast, or fine observation, rich fancy, and
      exquisite humour to him who imagined Will Honeycomb and Sir Roger de
      Coverley. He has paid particular attention to the history of the English
      drama, from the age of Elizabeth down to our own time, and has every right
      to be heard with respect on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plays to which he now acts as introducer are, with few exceptions,
      such as, in the opinion of many very respectable people, ought not to be
      reprinted. In this opinion we can by no means concur. We cannot wish that
      any work or class of works which has exercised a great influence on the
      human mind, and which illustrates the character of an important epoch in
      letters, politics and morals, should disappear from the world. If we err
      in this matter, we err with the gravest men and bodies of men in the
      empire, and especially with the Church of England, and with the great
      schools of learning which are connected with her. The whole liberal
      education of our countrymen is conducted on the principle, that no book
      which is valuable, either by reason of the excellence of its style, or by
      reason of the light which it throws on the history, polity, and manners of
      nations, should be withheld from the student on account of its impurity.
      The Athenian Comedies, in which there are scarcely a hundred lines
      together without some passage of which Rochester would have been ashamed,
      have been reprinted at the Pitt Press, and the Clarendon Press, under the
      direction of syndics and delegates appointed by the Universities, and have
      been illustrated with notes by reverend, very reverend, and right reverend
      commentators. Every year the most distinguished young men in the kingdom
      are examined <span class="pagenum">352</span><a name="link352" id="link352"></a>by
      bishops and professors of divinity in such works as the Lysistrata of
      Aristophanes and the Sixth Satire of Juvenal. There is certainly something
      a little ludicrous in the idea of a conclave of venerable fathers of the
      church praising and rewarding a lad on account of his intimate
      acquaintance with writings compared with which the loosest tale in Prior
      is modest. But, for our own part, we have no doubt that the great
      societies which direct the education of the English gentry have herein
      judged wisely. It is unquestionable that an extensive acquaintance with
      ancient literature enlarges and enriches the mind. It is unquestionable
      that a man whose mind has been thus enlarged and enriched is likely to be
      far more useful to the state and to the church than one who is unskilled,
      or little skilled, in classical learning. On the other hand, we find it
      difficult to believe that, in a world so full of temptation as this, any
      gentleman whose life would have been virtuous if he had not read
      Aristophanes and Juvenal will be made vicious by reading them. A man who,
      exposed to all the influences of such a state of society as that in which
      we live, is yet afraid of exposing himself to the influences of a few
      Greek or Latin verses, acts, we think, much like the felon who begged the
      sheriffs to let him have an umbrella held over his head from the door of
      Newgate to the gallows, because it was a drizzling morning, and he was apt
      to take cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The virtue which the world wants is a healthful virtue, mot a
      valetudinarian virtue, a virtue which can expose itself to the risks
      inseparable from all spirited exertion, not a virtue which keeps out of
      the common air for fear of infection, and eschews the common food as too
      stimulating. It would be indeed absurd to attempt <span class="pagenum">353</span><a
      name="link353" id="link353"></a>to keep men from acquiring those
      qualifications which fit them to play their part in life with honour to
      themselves and advantage to their country, for the sake of preserving a
      delicacy which cannot be preserved, a delicacy which a walk from
      Westminster to the Temple is sufficient to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we should be justly chargeable with gross inconsistency if, while we
      defend the policy which invites the youth of our country to study such
      writers as Theocritus and Catullus, we were to set up a cry against a new
      edition of the Countiy Wife or the Way of the World. The immoral English
      writers of the seventeenth century are indeed much less excusable than
      those of Greece and Rome. But the worst English writings of the
      seventeenth century are decent, compared with much that has been
      bequeathed to us by Greece and Rome. Plato, we have little doubt, was a
      much better man than Sir George Etherege. But Plato has written things at
      which Sir George Etherege would have shuddered. Buckhurst and Sedley, even
      in those wild orgies at the Cock in Bow Street for which they were pelted
      by the rabble and fined by the Court of King&rsquo;s, Bench, would never have
      dared to hold such discourse as passed between Socrates and Phædrus on
      that fine summer day under the plane-tree, while the fountain warbled at
      their feet, and the cicadas chirped overhead. If it be, as we think it is,
      desirable that an English gentleman should be well informed touching the
      government and the manners of little commonwealths which both in place and
      time are far removed from us, whose independence has been more than two
      thousand years extinguished, whose language has not been spoken for ages,
      and whose ancient magnificence is attested only by a few broken <span
      class="pagenum">354</span><a name="link354" id="link354"></a>columns and
      friezes, much more must it be desirable that lie should be intimately
      acquainted with the history of the public mind of his own country, and
      with the causes, the nature, and the extent of those revolutions of
      opinion and feeling which, during the last two centuries, have alternately
      raised and depressed the standard of our national morality. And knowledge
      of this sort is to be very sparingly gleaned from Parliamentary debates,
      from state papers, and from the works of grave historians. It must either
      not be acquired at all, or it must be acquired by the perusal of the light
      literature which has at various periods been fashionable. We are therefore
      by no means disposed to condemn this publication, though we certainly
      cannot recommend the handsome volume before us as an appropriate Christmas
      present for young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that we think the present publication perfectly justifiable.
      But we can by no means agree with Mr. Leigh Hunt, who seems to hold that
      there is little or no ground for the charge of immorality so often brought
      against the literature of the Restoration. We do not blame him for not
      bringing to the judgment-seat the merciless rigour of Lord Angelo; but we
      really think that such flagitious and impudent offenders as those who are
      now at the bar deserved at least the gentle rebuke of Escalus. Mr. Leigh
      Hunt treats the whole matter a little too much in the easy style of Lucio;
      and perhaps his exceeding lenity disposes us to be somewhat too severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it is not easy to be too severe. For in truth this part of our
      literature is a disgrace to our language and our national character. It is
      clever, indeed, and very entertaining; but it is, in the most emphatic
      sense of the words, &ldquo;earthly, sensual, devilish.&rdquo; Its <span class="pagenum">355</span><a
      name="link355" id="link355"></a>indecency, though perpetually such as is
      condemned not less by the rules of good taste than by those of morality,
      is not, in our opinion, so disgraceful a fault as its singularly inhuman
      spirit. We have here Belial, not as when he inspired Ovid and Ariosto,
      &ldquo;graceful and humane,&rdquo; but with the iron eye and cruel sneer of
      Mephistophiles. We find ourselves in a world, in which the ladies are like
      very profligate, impudent, and unfeeling men, and in which the men are too
      bad for any place but Pandæmonium or Norfolk Island. We are surrounded by
      foreheads of bronze, hearts like the nether millstone, and tongues set on
      fire of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dryden defended or excused his own offences and those of his
      contemporaries by pleading the example of the earlier English dramatists:
      and Mr. Leigh Hunt seems to think that there is force in the plea. We
      altogether differ from his opinion. The crime charged is not mere
      coarseness of expression. The terms which are delicate in one age become
      gross in the next. The diction of the English version of the Pentateuch is
      sometimes such as Addison would not have ventured to imitate; and Addison,
      the standard of moral purity in his own age, used many phrases which are
      now proscribed. Whether a thing shall be designated by a plain noun
      substantive or by a circumlocution is mere, matter of fashion. Morality is
      not at all interested in the question. But morality is deeply interested
      in this, that what is immoral shall not be presented to the imagination of
      the young and susceptible in constant connection with what is attractive.
      For every person who has observed the operation of the law of association
      in his own mind and in the minds of others knows that whatever is
      constantly presented to the imagination in connection with what is
      attractive will itself become attractive. <span class="pagenum">356</span><a
      name="link356" id="link356"></a>There is undoubtedly a great deal of
      indelicate writing in Fletcher and Massinger, and more than might be
      wished even in Ben Jonson and Shakspeare, who are comparatively pure. But
      it is impossible to trace in their plays any systematic attempt to
      associate vice with those things which men value most and desire most, and
      virtue with every thing ridiculous and degrading. And such a systematic
      attempt we find in the whole dramatic literature of the generation which
      followed the return of Charles the Second. We will take, as an instance of
      what we mean, a single subject of the highest importance to the happiness
      of mankind, conjugal fidelity. We can at present hardly call to mind a
      single English play, written before the civil war, in which the character
      of a seducer of married women is represented in a favourable light. We
      remember many plays in which such persons are baffled, exposed, covered
      with derision, and insulted by triumphant husbands. Such is the fate of
      Falstaff, with all his wit and knowledge of the world. Such is the fate of
      Brisac in Fletcher&rsquo;s Elder Brother, and of Ricardo and Ubaldo in
      Massinger&rsquo;s Picture. Sometimes, as in the Fatal Dowry and Love&rsquo;s Cruelty,
      the outraged honour of families is repaired by a bloody revenge. If now
      and then the lover is represented as an accomplished man, and the husband
      as a person of weak or odious character, this only makes the triumph of
      female virtue the more signal, as in Jonson&rsquo;s Celia and Mrs. Fitadottrel,
      and in Fletcher&rsquo;s Maria. In general we will venture to say that the
      dramatists of the age of Elizabeth and James the First either treat the
      breach of the marriage-vow as a serious crime, or, if they treat it as
      matter for laughter, turn the laugh against the gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, during the forty years which followed <span
      class="pagenum">357</span><a name="link357" id="link357"></a>the
      Restoration, the whole body of the dramatists invariably represent
      adultery, we do not say as a peccadillo, we do not say as an error which
      the violence of passion may excuse, but as the calling of a fine
      gentleman, as a grace without which his character would be imperfect. It
      is as essential to his breeding and to his place in society that he should
      make love to the wives of his neighbours as that he should know French, or
      that he should have a sword at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this there is no passion, and scarcely any thing that can be called
      preference. The hero intrigues just as he wears a wig; because, if he did
      not, he would be a queer fellow, a city prig, perhaps a Puritan. All the
      agreeable qualities are always given to the gallant. All the contempt and
      aversion are the portion of the unfortunate husband. Take Dryden for
      example; and compare Woodall with Brainsick, or Lorenzo with Gomez. Take
      Wycherley; and compare Horner with Pinchwife. Take Vanbrugh; and compare
      Constant with Sir John Brute. Take Farquhar; and compare Archer with
      Squire Sullen. Take Congreve; and compare Bellmour with Fondlewife,
      Careless with Sir Paul Plyant, or Scandal with Foresight. In all these
      cases, and in many more which might be named, the dramatist evidently does
      his best to make the person who commits the injury graceful, sensible, and
      spirited, and the person who suffers it a fool, or a tyrant, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Charles Lamb, indeed, attempted to set up a defence for this way of
      writing. The dramatists of the latter part of the seventeenth century are
      not, according to him, to be tried by the standard of morality which
      exists, and ought to exist, in real life. Their world is a conventional
      world. Their heroes and <span class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358"
       id="link358"></a>heroines belong, not to England, not to Christendom, but
      to an Utopia of gallantry, to a Fairyland, where the Bible and Burn&rsquo;s
      Justice are unknown, where a prank which on this earth would be rewarded
      with the pillory is merely matter for a peal of elvish laughter. A real
      Horner, a real Careless, would, it is admitted, be exceedingly bad men.
      But to predicate morality or immorality of the Homer of Wycherley and the
      Careless of Congreve is as absurd as it would be to arraign a sleeper for
      his dreams. &ldquo;They belong to the regions of pure comedy, where no cold
      moral reigns. When we are among them we are among a chaotic people. We are
      not to judge them by our usages. No reverend institutions are insulted by
      their proceedings, for they have none among them. No peace of families is
      violated, for no family ties exist among them. There is neither right nor
      wrong, gratitude or its opposite, claim or duty, paternity or sonship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is, we believe, a fair summary of Mr. Lamb&rsquo;s doctrine. We are sure
      that we do not wish to represent him unfairly. For we admire his genius;
      we love the kind nature which appears in all his writings; and we cherish
      his memory as much as if we had known him personally. But we must plainly
      say that his argument, though ingenious, is altogether sophistical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we perfectly understand that it is possible for a writer to
      create a conventional world in which things forbidden by the Decalogue and
      the Statute Book shall be lawful, and yet that the exhibition may be
      harmless, or even edifying. For example, we suppose that the most austere
      critics would not accuse Fenelon of impiety and immorality on account of
      his Telemachus and his Dialogues of the Dead. In Telemachus <span
      class="pagenum">359</span><a name="link359" id="link359"></a>and the
      Dialogues of the Dead we have a false religion, and consequently a
      morality which is in some points incorrect. We have a right and a wrong
      differing from the right and the wrong of real life. It is represented as
      the first duty of men to pay honour to Jove and Minerva. Philocles, who
      employs his leisure in making graven images of these deities, is extolled
      for his piety in a way which contrasts singularly with the expressions of
      Isaiah on the same subject. The dead are judged by Minos, and rewarded
      with lasting happiness for actions which Fenelon would have been the first
      to pronounce splendid sins. The same may be said of Mr. Southey&rsquo;s
      Mahommedan and Hindoo heroes and heroines. In Thalaba, to speak hi
      derogation of the Arabian imposter is blasphemy: to drink wine is a crime:
      to perform ablutions and to pay honour to the holy cities are works of
      merit. In the curse of Kehama, Kailyal is commended for her devotion to
      the statue of Mariataly, the goddess of the poor. But certainly no person
      will accuse Mr. Southey of having promoted or intended to promote either
      Islamism or Brahminism.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to see why the conventional worlds of Fenelon and Mr. Southey
      are unobjectionable. In the first place, they are utterly unlike the real
      world in which we live. The state of society, the laws even of the
      physical world, are so different from those with which we are familiar,
      that we cannot be shocked at finding the morality also very different. But
      in truth the morality of these conventional worlds differs from the
      morality of the real world only in points where there is no danger that
      the real world will ever go wrong. The generosity and docility of
      Telemachus, the fortitude, the modesty, the filial tenderness of Kailyal,
      are virtues of all ages and nations. And there was very <span
      class="pagenum">360</span><a name="link360" id="link360"></a>little danger
      that the Dauphin would worship Minerva, or that an English damsel would
      dance, with a bucket on her head, before the statue of Mariataly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case is widely different with what Mr. Charles Lamb calls the
      conventional world of Wycherley and Congreve. Here the garb, the manners,
      the topics of conversation are those of the real town and of the passing
      day. The hero is in all superficial accomplishments exactly the fine
      gentleman whom every youth in the pit would gladly resemble. The heroine
      is the fine lady whom every youth in the pit would gladly marry. The scene
      is laid in some place which is as well known to the audience as their own
      houses, in St. James&rsquo;s Park, or Hyde Park, or Westminster Hall. The lawyer
      bustles about with his bag, between the Common Pleas and the Exchequer.
      The Peer calls for his carriage to go to the House of Lords on a private
      bill. A hundred little touches are employed to make the fictitious world
      appear like the actual world. And the immorality is of a sort which never
      can be out of date, and which all the force of religion, law, and public
      opinion united can but imperfectly restrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the name of art, as well as in the name of virtue, we protest against
      the principle that the world of pure comedy is one into which no moral
      enters. If comedy be an imitation, under whatever conventions, of real
      life, how is it possible that it can have no reference to the great rule
      which directs life, and to feelings which are called forth by every
      incident of life? If what Mr. Charles Lamb says were correct, the
      inference would be that these dramatists did not in the least understand
      the very first principles of their craft. Pure landscape-painting into
      which no light or shade enters, pure portrait-painting into which no
      expression <span class="pagenum">361</span><a name="link361" id="link361"></a>enters,
      are phrases less at variance with sound criticism than pure comedy into
      which no moral enters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not the fact that the world of these dramatists is a world into
      which no moral enters. Morality constantly enters into that world, a sound
      morality, and an unsound morality; the sound morality to be insulted,
      derided, associated with every thing mean and hateful; the unsound
      morality to be set off to every advantage, and inculcated by all methods,
      direct and indirect. It is not the fact that none of the inhabitants of
      this conventional world feel reverence for sacred institutions and family
      ties. Fondlewife, Pinch wife, every person in short of narrow
      understanding and disgusting manners, expresses that reverence strongly.
      The heroes and heroines, too, have a moral code of their own, an
      exceedingly bad one, but not, as Mr. Charles Lamb seems to think, a code
      existing only in the imagination of dramatists. It is, on the contrary, a
      code actually received and obeyed by great numbers of people. We need not
      go to Utopia or Fairyland to find them.. They are near at hand. Every
      night some of them cheat at the hells in the Quadrant, and others pace the
      Piazza in Covent Garden. Without flying to Nephelococcygia or to the Court
      of Queen Mab, we can meet with sharpers, bullies, hard-hearted impudent
      debauchees, and women worthy of such paramours. The morality of the
      Country Wife and the Old Bachelor is the morality, not as Mr. Charles Lamb
      maintains, of an unreal world, but of a world which is a great deal too
      real. It is the morality, not of a chaotic people, but of low town-rakes,
      and of those ladies whom the newspapers call &ldquo;dashing Cyprians.&rdquo; And the
      question is simply this, whether a man of genius who constantly and
      systematically endeavours to make this <span class="pagenum">362</span><a
      name="link362" id="link362"></a>sort of character attractive, by uniting
      it with beauty, grace, dignity, spirit, a high social position,
      popularity, literature, wit, taste, knowledge of the world, brilliant
      success in every undertaking, does or does not make an ill use of his
      powers. We own that we are unable to understand how this question can be
      answered in any way but one.

      It must, indeed, be acknowledged, in justice to the writers of whom we
      have spoken thus severely, that they were, to a great extent, the
      creatures of their age. And if it be asked why that age encouraged
      immorality which no other age would have tolerated, we have no hesitation
      in answering that this great depravation of the national taste was the
      effect of the prevalence of Puritanism under the Commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To punish public outrages on morals and religion is unquestionably within
      the competence of rulers. But when a government, not content with
      requiring decency, requires sanctity, it oversteps the bounds which mark
      its proper functions. And it may be laid down as a universal rule that a
      government which attempts more than it ought will perform less. A lawgiver
      who, in order to protect distressed borrowers, limits the rate of
      interest, either makes it impossible for the objects of his care to borrow
      at all, or places them at the mercy of the worst class of usurers. A
      lawgiver who, from tenderness for labouring men, fixes the hours of their
      work and the amount of their wages, is certain to make them far more
      wretched than he found them. And so a government which, not content with
      repressing scandalous excesses, demands from its subjects fervent and
      austere piety, will soon discover that, while attempting to render an
      impossible service to the cause of virtue, it has in truth only promoted
      vice. <span class="pagenum">363</span><a name="link363" id="link363"></a>For
      what are the means by which a government can effect its ends? Two only,
      reward and punishment; powerful means, indeed, for influencing the
      exterior act, but altogether impotent for the purpose of touching the
      heart. A public functionary who is told that he will be promoted if he is
      a devout Catholic, and turned out of his place if he is not, will probably
      go to mass every morning, exclude meat from his table on Fridays, shrive
      himself regularly, and perhaps let his superiors know that he wears a hair
      shirt next his skin. Under a Puritan government, a person who is apprised
      that piety is essential to thriving in the world will be strict in the
      observance of the Sunday, or, as he will call it, Sabbath, and will avoid
      a theatre as if it were plague-stricken. Such a show of religion as this
      the hope of gain and the fear of loss will produce, at a week&rsquo;s notice, in
      any abundance which a government may require. But under this show,
      sensuality, ambition, avarice, and hatred retain unimpaired power, and the
      seeming convert has only added to the vices of a man of the world all the
      still darker vices which are engendered by the constant practice of
      dissimulation. The truth cannot be long concealed. The public discovers
      that the grave persons who are proposed to it as patterns are more utterly
      destitute of moral principle and of moral sensibility than avowed
      libertines. It sees that these Pharisees are farther removed from real
      goodness than publicans and harlots. And, as usual, it rushes to the
      extreme opposite to that which it quits. It considers a high religious
      profession as a sure mark of meanness and depravity. On the very first day
      on which the restraint of fear is taken away, and on which men can venture
      to say what they think, a frightful peal of blasphemy <span class="pagenum">364</span><a
      name="link364" id="link364"></a>and ribaldry proclaims that the
      short-sighted policy which aimed at making a nation of saints has made a
      nation of scoffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus in France about the beginning of the eighteenth century. Lewis
      the Fourteenth in his old age became religious: he determined that his
      subjects should be religious too: he shrugged his shoulders and knitted
      his brows if he observed at his levee or near his dinner-table any
      gentleman who neglected the duties enjoined by the church, and rewarded
      piety with blue ribands, invitations to Marli, governments, pensions, and
      regiments. Forthwith Versailles became, in everything but dress, a
      convent. The pulpits and confessionals were surrounded by swords and
      embroidery. The Marshals of France were much in prayer; and there was
      hardly one among the Dukes and Peers who did not carry good little books
      in his pocket, fast during Lent, and communicate at Easter. Madame de
      Main-tenon, who had a great share in the blessed work, boasted that
      devotion had become quite the fashion. A fashion indeed it was; and like a
      fashion it passed away. No sooner had the old king been carried to St.
      Denis than the whole court unmasked. Every man hastened to indemnify
      himself, by the excess of licentiousness and impudence, for years of
      mortification. The same persons who, a few months before, with meek voices
      and demure looks, had consulted divines about the state of their souls,
      now surrounded the midnight table where, amidst the bounding of champagne
      corks, a drunken prince, enthroned between Dubois and Madame de Parabère,
      hiccoughed out atheistical arguments and obscene jests. The early part of
      the reign of Lewis the Fourteenth had been a time of license; but the most
      dissolute men of that generation <span class="pagenum">365</span><a
      name="link365" id="link365"></a>would have blushed at the orgies of the
      Regency.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same with our fathers in the time of the Great Civil War. We
      are by no means unmindful of the great debt which mankind owes to the
      Puritans of that time, the deliverers of England, the founders of the
      American Commonwealths. But in the day of their power, those men committed
      one great fault, which left deep and lasting traces in the national
      character and manners. They mistook the end and overrated the force of
      government. They determined, not merely to protect religion and public
      morals from insult, an object for which the civil sword, in discreet
      hands, may be beneficially employed, but to make the people committed to
      their rule truly devout. Yet, if they had only reflected on events which
      they had themselves witnessed and in which they had themselves borne a
      great part, they would have seen what was likely to be the result of their
      enterprise. They had lived under a government which, during a long course
      of years, did all that could be done, by lavish bounty and by rigorous
      punishment, to enforce conformity to the doctrine and discipline of the
      Church of England. No person suspected of hostility to that church had the
      smallest chance of obtaining favour at the court of Charles; dissent was
      punished by imprisonment, by ignominious exposure, by cruel mutilations,
      and by ruinous fines. And the event had been that the Church had fallen,
      and had, in its fall, dragged down with it a monarchy which had stood six
      hundred years. The Puritan might have learned, if from nothing else, yet
      from his own recent victory, that governments which attempt things beyond
      their reach are likely not merely to fail, but to produce an <span
      class="pagenum">366</span><a name="link366" id="link366"></a>effect
      directly the opposite of that which they contemplate as desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was overlooked. The saints were to inherit the earth. The
      theatres were closed. The fine arts were placed under absurd restraints.
      Vices which had never before been even misdemeanors were made capital
      felonies. It was solemnly resolved by Parliament &ldquo;that no person shall be
      employed but such as the House shall be satisfied of his real godliness.&rdquo;
       The pious assembly had a Bible lying on the table for reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had consulted it they might have learned that the wheat and the
      tares grow together inseparably, and must either be spared together, or
      rooted up together. To know whether a man was really godly was impossible.
      But it was easy to know whether he had a plain dress, lank hair, no starch
      in his linen, no gay furniture in his house; whether he talked through his
      nose, and showed the whites of his eyes; whether he named his children
      Assurance, Tribulation, and Maher-shalal-hash-baz; whether he avoided
      Spring Garden when in town, and abstained from hunting and hawking when in
      the country; whether he expounded hard scriptures to his troops of
      dragoons, and talked in a committee of ways and means about seeking the
      Lord. These were tests which could easily be applied. The misfortune was
      that they were tests which proved nothing. Such as they were, they were
      employed by the dominant party. And the consequence was that a crowd of
      impostors, in every walk of life, began to mimic and to caricature what
      were then regarded as the outward signs of sanctity. The nation was not
      duped. The restraints of that gloomy time were such as would have been
      impatiently borne, if imposed by men who were universally believed to be
      saints. <span class="pagenum">367</span><a name="link367" id="link367"></a>Those
      restraints became altogether insupportable when they were known to be kept
      up for the profit of hypocrites. It is quite certain that, even if the
      royal family had never returned, even if Richard Cromwell or Henry
      Cromwell had been at the head of the administration, there would have been
      a great relaxation of manners. Before the Restoration many signs indicated
      that a period of license was at hand. The Restoration crushed for a time
      the Puritan party, and placed supreme power in the hands of a libertine.
      The political counter-revolution assisted the moral counter-revolution,
      and was in turn assisted by it. A period of wild and desperate
      dissoluteness followed. Even in remote manor-houses and hamlets the change
      was in some degree felt; but in Loudon the outbreak of debauchery was
      appalling; and in London the places most deeply infected were the Palace,
      the quarters inhabited by the aristocracy, and the Inns of Court. It was
      on the support of these parts of the town that the playhouses depended.
      The character of the drama became conformed to the character of its
      patrons. The comic poet was the mouthpiece of the most deeply corrupted
      part of a corrupted society. And in the plays before us we find, distilled
      and condensed, the essential spirit of the fashionable world during the
      Anti-puritan reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Puritan had affected formality; the comic poet laughed at decorum. The
      Puritan had frowned at innocent diversions; the comic poet took under his
      patronage the most flagitious excesses. The Puritan had canted; the comic
      poet blasphemed. The Puritan had made an affair of gallantry, felony
      without benefit of clergy; the comic poet represented it as an honourable
      distinction. The Puritan spoke with disdain of <span class="pagenum">368</span><a
      name="link368" id="link368"></a>the low standard of popular morality; his
      life was regulated by a far more rigid code; his virtue was sustained by
      motives unknown to men of the world. Unhappily it had been amply proved in
      many cases, and might well be suspected in many more, that these high
      pretensions were unfounded. Accordingly, the fashionable circles, and the
      comic poets who were the spokesmen of those circles, took up the notion
      that all professions of piety and integrity were to be construed by the
      rule of contrary; that it might well be doubted whether there was such a
      thing as virtue in the world; but that, at all events, a person who
      affected to be better than his neighbours was sure to be a knave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old drama there had been much that was reprehensible. But whoever
      compares even the least decorous plays of Fletcher with those contained in
      the volume before us will see how much the profligacy which follows a
      period of overstrained austerity goes beyond the profligacy which precedes
      such a period. The nation resembled the demoniac in the New Testament. The
      Puritans boasted that the unclean spirit was cast out. The house was
      empty, swept, and garnished; and for a time the expelled tenant wandered
      through dry places seeking rest and finding none. But the force of the
      exorcism was spent. The fiend returned to his abode; and returned not
      alone. He took to him seven other, spirits more wicked than himself. They
      entered in, and dwelt together: and the second possession was worse than
      the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now, as far as our limits will permit, pass in review the writers
      to whom Mr. Leigh Hunt has introduced us. Of the four, Wycherley stands,
      we think, last in literary merit, but first in order of time, and first,
      beyond all doubt, in immorality. <br /><span class="pfirst"><span
      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ILLIAM WYCHERLEY <span
      class="pagenum">369</span><a name="link369" id="link369"></a>was born in
      1640. He was the son of a Shropshire gentleman of old family, and of what
      was then accounted a good estate. The property was estimated at six
      hundred a year, a fortune which, among the fortunes at that time, probably
      ranked as a fortune of two thousand a year would rank in our days. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      William was an infant when the civil war broke ont; and, while he was
      still in his rudiments, a Presbyterian hierarchy and a republican
      government were established on the ruins of the ancient church and throne.
      Old Mr. Wycherley was attached to the royal cause, and was not disposed to
      intrust the education of his heir to the solemn Puritans who now ruled the
      universities and public schools. Accordingly the young gentleman was sent
      at fifteen to France. He resided some time in the neighbourhood of the
      Duke of Montausier, chief of one of the noblest families of Touraine. The
      Duke&rsquo;s wife, a daughter of the house of Rambouillet, was a finished
      specimen of those talents and accomplishments for which her race was
      celebrated. The young foreigner was introduced to the splendid circle
      which surrounded the duchess, and there he appears to have learned some
      good and some evil. In a few years he returned to his country a fine
      gentleman and a Papist. His conversion, it may safely be affirmed, was the
      effect, not of any strong impression on his understanding or feelings, but
      partly of intercourse with an agreeable society in which the Church of
      Rome was the fashion, and partly of that aversion to Calvinistic
      austerities which was then almost universal among young Englishmen of
      parts and spirit, and which, at one time, seemed likely to make one half
      of them Catholics, and the other half Atheists. <span class="pagenum">370</span><a
      name="link370" id="link370"></a>But the Restoration came. The universities
      were again in loyal hands; and there was reason to hope that there would
      be again a national church fit for a gentleman. Wycherley became a member
      of Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, and abjured the errors of the Church of Rome.
      The somewhat equivocal glory of turning, for a short time, a
      good-for-nothing Papist into a good-for-nothing Protestant is ascribed to
      Bishop Barlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wycherley left Oxford without taking a degree, and entered at the Temple,
      where he lived gaily for some years, observing the humours of the town,
      enjoying its pleasures, and picking up just as much law as was necessary
      to make the character of a pettifogging attorney or of a litigious client
      entertaining in a comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an early age he had been in the habit of amusing himself by writing.
      Some wretched lines of his on the Restoration are still extant. Had he
      devoted himself to the making of verses, he would have been nearly as far
      below Tate and Blackmore as Tate and Black-more are below Dryden. His only
      chance for renown would have been that he might have occupied a niche in a
      satire, between Flecknoe and Settle. There was, however, another kind of
      composition in which his talents and acquirements qualified him to
      succeed; and to that he judiciously betook himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his old age he used to say that he wrote Love in a Wood at nineteen,
      the Gentleman Dancing-Master at twenty-one, the Plain Dealer at
      twenty-five, and the Country Wife at one or two and thirty. We are
      incredulous, we own, as to the truth of this story. Nothing that we know
      of Wycherley leads us to think him incapable of sacrificing truth to
      vanity. And his memory in the decline of his life played him such strange
      tricks that we might question the correctness of <span class="pagenum">371</span><a
      name="link371" id="link371"></a>his assertion without throwing any
      imputation on his veracity. It is certain that none of his plays was acted
      till 1672, when he gave Love in a Wood to the public. It seems improbable
      that he should resolve, on so important an occasion as that of a first
      appearance before the world, to ran his chance with a feeble piece,
      written before his talents were ripe, before his style was formed, before
      he had looked abroad into the world; and this when he had actually in his
      desk two highly finished, plays, the fruit of his matured powers. When we
      look minutely at the pieces themselves, we find in every part of them
      reason to suspect the accuracy of Wycherley&rsquo;s statement. In the first
      scene of Love in a Wood, to go no further, we find many passages which he
      could not have written when he was nineteen. There is an allusion to
      gentlemen&rsquo;s periwigs, which first came into fashion in 1663; an allusion
      to guineas, which were first struck in 1683; an allusion to the vests
      which Charles ordered to be worn at court in 1666; an allusion to the fire
      of 1666; and several political allusions which must be assigned to times
      later than the year of the Restoration, to times when the government and
      the city were opposed to each other, and when the Presbyterian ministers
      had been driven from the parish churches to the conventicles. But it is
      needless to dwell on particular expressions. The whole air and spirit of
      the piece belong to a period subsequent to that mentioned by Wycherley. As
      to the Plain Dealer, which is said to have been written when he was
      twenty-five, it contains one scene unquestionably written after 1675,
      several which are later than 1668, and scarcely a line which can have been
      composed before the end of 1666.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever may have been the age at which Wycherley <span class="pagenum">372</span><a
      name="link372" id="link372"></a>composed his plays, it is certain that he
      did not bring them before the public till he was upwards of thirty. In
      1672, Love in a Wood was acted with more success than it deserved, and
      this event produced a great change in the fortunes of the author. The
      Duchess of Cleveland cast her eyes upon him, and was pleased with his
      appearance. This abandoned woman, not content with her complaisant husband
      and her royal keeper, lavished her fondness on a crowd of paramours of all
      ranks, from dukes to rope-dancers. In the time of the commonwealth she
      commenced her career of gallantry, and terminated it under Anne, by
      marrying, when a great-grandmother, that worthless fop, Beau Fielding. It
      is not strange that she should have regarded Wycherley with favour. His
      figure was commanding, his countenance strikingly handsome, his look and
      deportment full of grace and dignity. He had, as Pope said long after,
      &ldquo;the true nobleman look,&rdquo; the look which seems to indicate superior, and a
      not unbecoming consciousness of superiority. His hair indeed, as he says
      in one of his poems, was prematurely grey. But in that age of periwigs
      this misfortune was of little importance. The Duchess admired him, and
      proceeded to make love to him, after the fashion of the coarse-minded and
      shameless circle to which she belonged. In the Ring, when the crowd of
      beauties and fine gentlemen was thickest, she put her head out of her
      coach-window, and bawled to him, &ldquo;Sir, you are a rascal; you are a
      villain;&rdquo; and, if she is not belied, she added another phrase of abuse
      which we will not quote, but of which we may say that it might most justly
      have been applied to her own children. Wycherley called on her Grace the
      next day, and with great humility begged to know in what way <span
      class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373" id="link373"></a>he had been
      so unfortunate as to disoblige her. Thus began an intimacy from which the
      poet probably expected wealth and honours. Nor were such expectations
      unreasonable. A handsome young fellow about the court, known by the name
      of Jack Churchill, was, about the same time, so lucky as to become the
      object of a short-lived fancy of the Duchess. She had presented him with
      four thousand five hundred pounds, the price, in all probability, of some
      title or pardon. The prudent youth had lent the money on high interest,
      and on landed security; and this judicious investment was the beginning of
      the most splendid private fortune in Europe. Wycherley was not so lucky.
      The partiality with which the great lady regarded him was indeed the talk
      of the whole town; and sixty years later old men who remembered those days
      told Voltaire that she often stole from the court to her lover&rsquo;s chambers
      in the Temple, disguised like a country girl, with a straw-hat on her
      head, pattens on her feet, and a basket in her hand. The poet was indeed
      too happy and proud to be discreet. He dedicated to the Duchess the play
      which had led to their acquaintance, and in the dedication expressed
      himself in terms which could not but confirm the reports which had gone
      abroad. But at Whitehall such an affair was regarded in no serious light.
      The lady was not afraid to bring Wycherley to court, and to introduce him
      to a splendid society with which, as far as appears, he had never before
      mixed. The easy king, who allowed to his mistresses the same liberty which
      he claimed for himself, was pleased with the conversation and manners of
      his new rival. So high did Wycherley stand in the royal favour that once,
      when he was confined by a fever to his lodgings in Bow Street, Charles,
      who, with all his <span class="pagenum">374</span><a name="link374"
       id="link374"></a>faults, was certainly a man of social and affable
      disposition, called on him, sat by his bed, advised him to try change of
      air, and gave him a handsome sum of money to defray the expense of a
      journey. Buckingham, then Master of the Horse, and one of that infamous
      ministry known by the name of the Cabal, had been one of the Duchess&rsquo;s
      innumerable paramours. He at first showed some symptoms of jealousy; but
      he soon, after his fashion, veered round from anger to fondness, and gave
      Wycherley a commission in his own regiment and a place in the royal
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unjust to Wycherley&rsquo;s memory not to mention here the only good
      action, as far as we know, of his whole life. He is said to have made
      great exertions to obtain the patronage of Buckingham for the illustrious
      author of Hudribas, who was now sinking into an obscure grave, neglected
      by a nation proud of his genius, and by a court which he had served too
      well. His Grace consented to see poor Butler; and an appointment was made.
      But unhappily two pretty women passed by; the volatile Duke ran after
      them; the opportunity was lost, and could never be regained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second Dutch war, the most disgraceful war in the whole history of
      England, was now raging. It was not in that age considered as by any means
      necessary that a naval officer should receive a professional education.
      Young men of rank, who were hardly able to keep their feet in a breeze,
      served on board of the King&rsquo;s ships, sometimes with commissions, and
      sometimes as volunteers. Mulgrave, Dorset, Rochester, and many others,
      left the playhouses and the Mall for hammocks and salt pork, and, ignorant
      as they were of the rudiments of naval service, showed, at least, on the
      day of battle, the courage which is seldom wanting in <span class="pagenum">375</span><a
      name="link375" id="link375"></a>an English gentleman. All good judges of
      maritime affairs complained that, under this system, the ships were
      grossly mismanaged, and that the tarpaulins contracted the vices, without
      acquiring the graces, of the court. But on this subject, as on every other
      where the interests or whims of favourites were concerned, the government
      of Charles was deaf to all remonstrances. Wycherley did not choose to be
      out of the fashion. He embarked, was present at a battle, and celebrated
      it, on his return, in a copy of verses too had for the bellman. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time, he brought on the stage his second piece, the
      Gentleman Dancing-Master. The biographers say nothing, as far as we
      remember, about the fate of this play. There is, however, reason to
      believe that, though certainly far superior to Love in a Wood, it was not
      equally successful. It was first tried at the west end of the town, and,
      as the poet confessed, &ldquo;would scarce do there.&rdquo; It was then performed in
      Salisbury Court, but, as it should seem, with no better event. For, in the
      prologue to the Country Wife,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Mr. Leigh Hunt supposes that the battle at which
     Wycherley was present was that which the Duke of York gained
     over Opdam, in 1665. We believe that it was one of the
     battles between Rupert and De Ruyter, in 1673.

     The point is of no importance; and there cannot be said to
     be much evidence either way. We offer, however, to Mr. Leigh
     Hunt&rsquo;s consideration three arguments, of no great weight
     certainly, yet such as ought, we think, to prevail in the
     absence of better. First, it is not very likely that a young
     Templar, quite unknown in the world,&mdash;and Wycherley was
     such in 1665,&mdash;should have quitted his chambers to go to
     sea. On the other hand, it would be in the regular course of
     things, that, when a courtier and an equerry, he should
     offer his services. Secondly, his verses appear to have been
     written after a drawn battle, like those of 1673, and not
     after a complete victory, like that of 1675. Thirdly, in the
     epilogue to the Gentleman Dancing-Master, written in 1673,
     he says that &ldquo;all gentlemen must pack to sea an expression
     which makes it probable that he did not himself mean to stay
     behind.
</pre>
    <p>
      Wycherley <span class="pagenum">376</span><a name="link376" id="link376"></a>described
      himself as &ldquo;the late so baffled scribbler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In 1675, the Country Wife was performed with brilliant success, which, in
      a literary point of view, was not wholly unmerited. For, though one of the
      most profligate and heartless of human compositions, it is the elaborate
      production of a mind, not indeed rich, original, or imaginative, but
      ingenious, observant, quick to seize hints, and patient of the toil of
      polishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plain Dealer, equally immoral and equally well written, appeared in
      1677. At first this piece pleased the people less than the critics; but
      after a time its unquestionable merits and the zealous support of Lord
      Dorset, whose influence in literary and fashionable society was unbounded,
      established it in the public favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortune of Wycherley was now in the zenith, and began to decline.&rsquo; A
      long life was still before him. But it was destined to be filled with
      nothing but shame and wretchedness, domestic dissensions, literary
      failures, and pecuniary embarrassments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, who was looking about for an accomplished man to conduct the
      education of his natural son, the young Duke of Richmond, at length fixed
      on Wycherley. The poet, exulting in his good luck, went down to amuse
      himself at Tunbridge Wells, looked into a bookseller&rsquo;s shop on the
      Pantiles, and, to his great delight, heard a handsome woman ask for the
      Plain Dealer which had just been published. He made acquaintance with the
      lady, who proved to be the Countess of Drogheda, a gay young widow, with
      an ample jointure. She was charmed with his person and his wit, and, after
      a short flirtation, agreed to become his wife. Wycherley seems to have
      been apprehensive <span class="pagenum">377</span><a name="link377"
       id="link377"></a>that this connection might not suit well with the King&rsquo;s
      plans respecting the Duke of Richmond. He accordingly prevailed on the
      lady to consent to a private marriage. All came out. Charles thought the
      conduct of Wycherley both disrespectful and disingenuous. Other causes
      probably assisted to alienate the sovereign from the subject who had
      lately been so highly favoured. Buckingham was now in opposition, and had
      been committed to the Tower; not, as Mr. Leigh Hunt supposes, on a charge
      of treason, but by an order of the House of Lords for some expressions
      which he had used in debate. Wycherley wrote some bad lines in praise of
      his imprisoned patron, which, if they came to the knowledge of the King,
      would certainly have made his majesty very angry. The favour of the court
      was completely withdrawn from the poet. An amiable woman with a large
      fortune might indeed have been an ample compensation for the loss. But
      Lady Drogheda was ill-tempered, imperious, and extravagantly jealous. She
      had herself been a maid of honour at Whitehall. She well knew in what
      estimation conjugal fidelity was held among the fine gentlemen there, and
      watched her town husband as assiduously as Mr. Pinchwife watched his
      country wife. The unfortunate wit was, indeed, allowed to meet his friends
      at a tavern opposite to his own house. But on such occasions the windows
      were always open, in order that her Ladyship, who was posted on the other
      side of the street, might be satisfied that no woman was of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Lady Drogheda released the poet from this distress; but a
      series of disasters, in rapid succession, broke down his health, his
      spirits, and his fortune. His wife meant to leave him a good property,
      <span class="pagenum">378</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a>and
      left him only a lawsuit. His father could not or would not assist him.
      Wycherley was at length thrown into the Fleet, and languished there during
      seven years utterly forgotten, as it should seem, by the gay and lively
      circle of which he had been a distinguished ornament. In the extremity of
      his distress he implored the publisher who had been enriched by the sale
      of his works to lend him twenty pounds, and was refused. His comedies,
      however, still kept possession of the stage, and drew great audiences
      which troubled themselves little about the situation of the author. At
      length James the Second, who had now succeeded to the throne, happened to
      go to the theatre on an evening when the Plain Dealer was acted. He was
      pleased by the performance, and touched by the fate of the writer, whom he
      probably remembered as one of the gayest and handsomest of his brother&rsquo;s
      courtiers. The King determined to pay Wycherley&rsquo;s debts, and to settle on
      the unfortunate poet a pension of two hundred pounds a year. This
      munificence on the part of a prince who was little in the habit of
      rewarding literary merit, and whose whole soul was devoted to the
      interests of his church, raises in us a surmise which Mr. Leigh Hunt will,
      we fear, pronounce very uncharitable. We cannot help suspecting that it
      was at this time that Wycherley returned to the communion of the Church of
      Rome. That he did return to the communion of the Church of Rome is
      certain. The date of his reconversion, as far as we know, has never been
      mentioned by any biographer. We believe that, if we place it at this time,
      we do no injustice to the character either of Wycherley or James.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, old Mr. Wycherley died; and his son, <span class="pagenum">379</span><a
      name="link379" id="link379"></a>now past the middle of life, came to the
      family estate. Still, however, he was not at his ease. His embarrassments
      were great: his property was strictly tied up; and he was on very had
      terms with the heir-at-law. He appears to have led, during a long course
      of years, that most wretched life, the life of a vicious old boy about
      town. Expensive tastes with little money, and licentious appetites with
      declining vigour, were the just penance for his early irregularities. A
      severe illness had produced a singular effect on his intellect. His memory
      played him pranks stranger than almost any that are to be found in the
      history of that strange faculty. It seemed to be at once preternaturally
      strong, and preternaturally weak. If a book was read to him before he went
      to bed, he would wake the next morning with his mind full of the thoughts
      and expressions which he had heard over night; and he would write them
      down, without in the least suspecting that they were not his own. In his
      verses the same ideas, and even the same words, came over and over again
      several times in a short composition. His fine person bore the marks of
      age, sickness, and sorrow; and he mourned for his departed beauty with an
      effeminate regret. He could not look without a sigh at the portrait which
      Lely had painted of him when he was only twenty-eight, and often murmured,
      <i>Quantum mutatus ab illo</i>. He was still nervously anxious about his
      literary reputation, and, not content with the fame which he still
      possessed as a dramatist, was determined to be renowned as a satirist and
      an amatory poet. In 1704, after twenty-seven years of silence, he again
      appeared as an author. He put forth a large folio of miscellaneous verses,
      which, we believe, has never been reprinted. Some of these pieces had
      probably circulated through <span class="pagenum">380</span><a
      name="link380" id="link380"></a>the town in manuscript. For, before the
      volume appeared, the critics at the coffee-houses very confidently
      predicted that it would be utterly worthless, and were in consequence
      bitterly reviled by the poet in an ill-written, foolish, and egotistical
      preface. The book amply vindicated the most unfavourable prophecies that
      had been hazarded. The style and versification are beneath criticism; the
      morals are those of Rochester. For Rochester, indeed, there was some
      excuse. When his offences against decorum were committed, he was a very
      young man, misled by a prevailing fashion. Wycherley was sixty-four. He
      had long outlived the times when libertinism was regarded as essential to
      the character of a wit and a gentleman. Most of the rising poets, Addison,
      for example, John Phillips, and Rowe, were studious of decency. We can
      hardly conceive any thing more miserable than the figure which the ribald
      old man makes in the midst of so many sober and well-conducted youths.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very year in which this bulky volume of obscene doggerel was
      published, Wycherley formed an acquaintance of a very singular kind. A
      little, pale, crooked, sickly, bright-eyed urchin, just turned of sixteen,
      had written some copies of verses in which discerning judges could detect
      the promise of future eminence. There was, indeed, as yet nothing very
      striking or original in the conceptions of the young poet. But he was
      already skilled in the art of metrical composition. His diction and his
      music were not those of the great old masters; but that which his ablest
      contemporaries were labouring to do, he already did best. His style was
      not richly poetical; but it was&rsquo; always neat, compact, and pointed. His
      verse wanted variety of pause, of swell, and of cadence, but never grated
      <span class="pagenum">381</span><a name="link381" id="link381"></a>harshly
      on the ear, or disappointed it by a feeble close. The youth was already
      free of the company of wits, and was greatly elated at being introduced to
      the author of the Plain Dealer and the Country Wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious to trace the history of the intercourse which took place
      between Wycherley and Pope, between the representative of the age that was
      going out, and the representative of the age that was coming in, between
      the friend of Rochester and Buckingham, and the friend of Lyttelton and
      Mansfield. At first the boy was enchanted by the kindness and
      condescension of so eminent a writer, haunted his door, and followed him
      about like a spaniel from coffee-house to coffeehouse. Letters full of
      affection, humility, and fulsome flattery were interchanged between the
      friends. But the first ardour of affection could not last. Pope, though at
      no time scrupulously delicate in his writings or fastidious as to the
      morals of his associates, was shocked by the indecency of a rake who, at
      seventy, was still the representative of the monstrous profligacy of the
      Restoration. As the youth grew older, as his mind expanded and his fame
      rose, he appreciated both himself and Wycherley more correctly. He felt a
      just contempt for the old gentleman&rsquo;s verses, and was at no great pains to
      conceal his opinion. Wycherley, on the other hand, though blinded by
      self-love to the imperfections of what he called his poetry, could not but
      see that there was an immense difference between his young companion&rsquo;s
      rhymes and his own. He was divided between two feelings. He wished to have
      the assistance of so skilful a hand to polish his lines; and yet he shrank
      from the humiliation of being beholden for literary assistance to a lad
      who might have been his grandson. Pope was willing to give assistance, but
      <span class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a>was by
      no means disposed to give assistance and flattery too. He took the trouble
      to retouch whole reams of feeble stumbling verses, and inserted many
      vigorous lines which the least skilful reader will distinguish in an
      instant. But he thought that by these services he acquired a right to
      express himself in terms which would not, under ordinary circumstances,
      become one who was addressing a man of four times his age. In one letter
      he tells Wycherley that &ldquo;the worst pieces are such as, to render them very
      good, would require almost the entire new writing of them.&rdquo; In another, he
      gives the following account of his corrections: &ldquo;Though the whole be as
      short again as at first, there is not one thought omitted but what is a
      repetition of something in your first volume, or in this very paper; and
      the versification throughout is, I believe, such as nobody can be shocked
      at. The repeated permission you give me of dealing freely with you, will,
      I hope, excuse what I have done; for, if I have not spared you when I
      thought severity would do you a kindness, I have not mangled you where
      there was no absolute need of amputation.&rdquo; Wycherley continued to return
      thanks for all this hacking and hewing, which was, indeed, of inestimable
      service to his compositions. But at last his thanks began to sound very
      like reproaches. In private, he is said to have described Pope as a person
      who could not cut out a suit, but who had some skill in turning old coats.
      In his letters to Pope, while he acknowledged that the versification of
      the poems had been greatly improved, he spoke of the whole art of
      versification with scorn, and sneered at those who preferred sound to
      sense. Pope revenged himself for this outbreak of spleen by return of
      post. He had in his hands a volume of Wycherley&rsquo;s rhymes, <span
      class="pagenum">383</span><a name="link383" id="link383"></a>and he wrote
      to say that this volume was so full of faults that he could not correct it
      without completely defacing the manuscript. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;equally
      afraid of sparing you, and of offending you by too impudent a correction.&rdquo;
       This was more than flesh and blood could bear. Wycherley reclaimed his
      papers, in a letter in which resentment shows itself plainly through the
      thin disguise of civility. Pope, glad to be rid of a troublesome and
      inglorious task, sent back the deposit, and, by way of a parting courtesy,
      advised the old man to turn his poetry into prose, and assured him that
      the public would like thoughts much better without his versification. Thus
      ended this memorable correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wycherley lived some years after the termination of the strange friendship
      which we have described. The last scene of his life was, perhaps, the most
      scandalous. Ten days before his death, at seventy-five, he married a young
      girl, merely in order to injure his nephew, an act which proves that
      neither years, nor adversity, nor what he called his philosophy, nor
      either of the religions which he had at different times professed, had
      taught him the rudiments of morality. He died in December, 1715, and lies
      in the vault under the church of St. Paul in Convent-Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bride soon after married a Captain Shrimpton, who thus became
      possessed of a large collection of manuscripts. These were sold to a
      bookseller. They were so full of erasures and interlineations that no
      printer could decipher them. It was necessary to call in the aid of a
      professed critic; and Theobald, the editor of Shakspeare, and the hero of
      the first Dunciad, was employed to ascertain the true reading. In this way
      a volume of miscellanies in verse and prose was <span class="pagenum">384</span><a
      name="link384" id="link384"></a>got up for the market. The collection
      derives all its value from the traces of Pope&rsquo;s hand, which are everywhere
      discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the moral character of Wycherley it can hardly be necessary for us to
      say more. His fame as a writer rests wholly on his comedies, and chiefly
      on the last two. Even as a comic writer, he was neither of the best
      school, nor highest in his school. He was in truth a worse Congreve. His
      chief merit, like Congreve&rsquo;s, lies in the style of his dialogue. But the
      wit which lights up the Plain Dealer and the Country Wife is pale and
      flickering, when compared with the gorgeous blaze which dazzles us almost
      to blindness in Love for Love and the Way of the World. Like Congreve,
      and, indeed, even more than Congreve, Wycherley is ready to sacrifice
      dramatic propriety to the liveliness of his dialogue. The poet speaks out
      of the mouths of all his dunces and coxcombs, and makes them describe
      themselves with a good sense and acuteness which puts them on a level with
      the wits and heroes. We will give two instances, the first which occur to
      us, from the Country Wife. There are in the world fools who find the
      society of old friends insipid, and who are always running after new
      companions. Such a character is a fair subject for comedy. But nothing can
      be more absurd than to introduce a man of this sort saying to his comrade,
      &ldquo;I can deny you nothing: for though I have known thee a great while, never
      go if I do not love thee as well as a new acquaintance.&rdquo; That town-wits,
      again, have always been rather a heartless class, is true. But none of
      them, we will answer for it, ever said to a young lady to whom he was
      making love, &ldquo;We wits rail and make love often, but to show our parts: as
      we have no affections, so we have no malice.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">385</span><a
      name="link385" id="link385"></a>Wycherley&rsquo;s plays are said to have been
      the produce of long and patient labour. The epithet of &ldquo;slow&rdquo; was early
      given to him by Rochester, and was frequently repeated. In truth his mind,
      unless we are greatly mistaken, was naturally a very meagre soil, and was
      forced only by great labour and outlay to hear fruit which, after all, was
      not of the highest flavour. He has scarcely more claim to originality than
      Terence. It is not too much to say that there is hardly any thing of the
      least value in his plays of which the hint is not to be found elsewhere.
      The best scenes in the Gentleman Dancing Master were suggested by
      Calderon&rsquo;s <i>Maestro de Danzar</i>, not by any means one of the happiest
      comedies of the great Castilian poet. The Country Wife is borrowed from
      the <i>E&rsquo;cole des Maris</i> and the <i>E&rsquo;cole des Femmes</i>. The
      groundwork of the Plain Dealer is taken from the <i>Misanthrope</i> of
      Molière. One whole scene is almost translated from the <i>Critique de
      l&rsquo;E&rsquo;cole des Femmes</i>. Fidelia is Shakspeare&rsquo;s Viola stolen, and marred
      in the stealing; and the Widow Blackacre, beyond comparison Wycherley&rsquo;s
      best comic character, is the Countess in Racine&rsquo;s <i>Plaideurs</i>,
      talking the jargon of English instead of that of French chicane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing original about Wycherley, the only thing which he could
      furnish from his own mind in inexhaustible abundance, was profligacy. It
      is curious to observe how every thing that he touched, however pure and
      noble, took in an instant the colour of his own mind. Compare the <i>E&rsquo;cole
      des Femmes</i> with the Country Wife. Agnes is a simple and amiable girl,
      whose heart is indeed full of love, but of love sanctioned by honour,
      morality, and religion. Her natural talents are great. They have been
      hidden, and, as it <span class="pagenum">386</span><a name="link386"
       id="link386"></a>might appear, destroyed by an education elaborately bad.
      But they are called forth into full energy by a virtuous passion. Her
      lover, while he adores her beauty, is too honest a man to abuse the
      confiding tenderness of a creature so charming and inexperienced.
      Wycherley takes this plot into his hands; and forthwith this sweet and
      graceful courtship becomes a licentious intrigue of the lowest and least
      sentimental kind, between an impudent London rake and the idiot wife of a
      country squire. We will not go into details. In truth, Wycherley&rsquo;s
      indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against
      the hunters. It is safe, because it is too filthy to handle, and too
      noisome even to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the same with the Plain Dealer. How careful has Shakspeare been in
      Twelfth Night to preserve the dignity and delicacy of Viola under her
      disguise! Even when wearing a page&rsquo;s doublet and hose, she is never mixed
      up with any transaction which the most fastidious mind could regard as
      leaving a stain on her. She is employed by the Duke on an embassy of love
      to Olivia, but on an embassy of the most honourable kind. Wycherley
      borrows Viola; and Viola forthwith becomes a pandar of the basest sort.
      But the character of Manly is the best illustration of our meaning.
      Moliere exhibited in his misanthrope a pure and noble mind, which had been
      sorely vexed by the sight of perfidy and malevolence, disguised under the
      forms of politeness. As every extreme naturally generates its contrary,
      Alceste adopts a standard of good and evil directly opposed to that of the
      society which surrounds him. Courtesy seems to him a vice; and those stem
      virtues which are neglected by the fops and coquettes of Paris become too
      exclusively the objects of his veneration. <span class="pagenum">387</span><a
      name="link387" id="link387"></a>He is often to blame; he is often
      ridiculous; but he is always a good man; and the feeling which he inspires
      is regret that a person so estimable should be so unamiable. Wycherley
      borrowed Alceste, and turned him,&mdash;we quote the words of so lenient a
      critic as Mr. Leigh Hunt,&mdash;into &ldquo;a ferocious sensualist, who believed
      himself as great a rascal as he thought everybody else.&rdquo; The surliness of
      Moliere&rsquo;s hero is copied and caricatured. But the most nauseous
      libertinism and the most dastardly fraud are substituted for the purity
      and integrity of the original. And, to make the whole complete, Wycherley
      does not seem to have been aware that he was not drawing the portrait of
      an eminently honest man. So depraved was his moral taste that, while he
      firmly believed that he was producing a picture of virtue too exalted for
      the commerce of this world, he was really delineating the greatest rascal
      that is to be found, even in his own writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pass a very severe censure on Wycherley, when we say that it is a
      relief to turn from him to Congreve. Congreve&rsquo;s writings, indeed, are by
      no means pure; nor was he, as far as we are able to judge, a warm-hearted
      or high-minded man. Yet, in coming to him, we feel that the worst is over,
      that we are one remove further from the Restoration, that we are past the
      Nadir of national taste and morality. <br /><span class="pfirst"><span
      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ILLIAM CONGREVE was born
      in 1670, at Bardsey, in the neighbourhood of Leeds. His father, a younger
      son of a very ancient Staffordshire family, had distinguished himself
      among the cavaliers in the civil war, was set down after the Restoration
      for the Order of the Royal Oak, and subsequently settled in Ireland, under
      the patronage of the Earl of Burlington. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Congreve passed his childhood and youth in Ireland. <span class="pagenum">388</span><a
      name="link388" id="link388"></a>He was sent to school at Kilkenny, and
      thence went to the University of Dublin. His learning does great honour to
      his instructors. From his writings it appears, not only that he was well
      acquainted with Latin literature, but that his knowledge of the Greek
      poets was such as was not, in his time, common even in a college.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he, had, completed his academical studies, he was sent to London to
      study the law, and was entered of the Middle Temple. He troubled himself,
      however, very little about pleading or conveyancing, and gave himself up
      to literature and society. Two kinds of ambition early took possession of
      his mind, and often pulled it in opposite directions. He was conscious of
      great fertility of thought and power of ingenious combination. His lively
      conversation, his polished manners, and his highly respectable
      connections, had obtained for him ready access to the best company. He
      longed to be a great writer. He longed to be a man of fashion. Either
      object was within his reach. But could he secure both? Was there not
      something vulgar in letters, something inconsistent with the easy
      apathetic graces of a man of the mode? Was it aristocratical to be
      confounded with creatures who lived in the cocklofts of Grub Street, to
      bargain with publishers, to hurry printers&rsquo; devils and be hurried by them,
      to squabble with managers, to be applauded or hissed by pit, boxes, and
      galleries? Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age?
      Could he attain that renown without sullying what he valued quite as much,
      his character for gentility? The history of his life is the history of a
      conflict between these two impulses. In his youth the desire of literary
      fame had the mastery; but soon the meaner ambition overpowered the higher,
      and obtained supreme dominion over his mind. <span class="pagenum">389</span><a
      name="link389" id="link389"></a>His first work, a novel of no great value,
      he published under the assumed name of Cleophil. His second was the Old
      Bachelor, acted in 1693, a play inferior indeed to his other comedies,
      but, in its own line, inferior to them alone. The plot is equally
      destitute of interest and of probability. The characters are either not
      distinguishable, or are distinguished only by peculiarities of the most
      glaring kind. But the dialogue is resplendent with wit and eloquence,
      which indeed are so abundant that the fool comes in for an ample share,
      and yet preserves a certain colloquial air, a certain indescribable ease,
      of which Wycherley had given no example, and which Sheridan in vain
      attempted to imitate. The author, divided between pride and shame, pride
      at having written a good play, and shame at having done an ungentlemanlike
      thing, pretended that he had merely scribbled a few scenes for his own
      amusement, and affected to yield unwillingly to the importunities of those
      who pressed him to try his fortune on the stage. The Old Bachelor was seen
      in manuscript by Dryden, one of whose best qualities was a hearty and
      generous admiration for the talents of others. He declared that he had
      never read such a first play, and lent his services to bring it into a
      form fit for representation. Nothing was wanted to the success of the
      piece. It was so cast as to bring into play all the comic talent, and to
      exhibit on the boards in one view all the beauty, which Drury Lane
      Theatre, then the only theatre in London, could assemble. The result was a
      complete triumph; and the author was gratified with rewards more
      substantial than the applauses of the pit. Montagu, then a lord of the
      treasury, immediately gave him a place, and, in a short time, added the
      reversion of another place of much <span class="pagenum">390</span><a
      name="link390" id="link390"></a>greater value, which, however, did not
      become vacant till many years had elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1694, Congreve brought out the Double Dealer, a comedy in which all the
      powers which had produced the Old Bachelor showed themselves, matured by
      time and improved by exercise. But the audience was shocked by the
      characters of Maskwell and Lady Touchwood. And, indeed, there is something
      strangely revolting in the way in which a group that seems to belong to
      the house of Laius or of Pelops is introduced into the midst of the
      Brisks, Froths, Carlesses, and Plyants. The play was unfavourably
      received. Yet, if the praise of distinguished men could compensate an
      author for the disapprobation of the multitude, Congreve had no reason to
      repine. Dryden, in one of the most ingenious, magnificent, and pathetic
      pieces that he ever wrote, extolled the author of the Double Dealer in
      terms which now appear extravagantly hyperbolical. Till Congreve came
      forth,&mdash;so ran this exquisite flattery,&mdash;the superiority of the
      poets who preceded the civil wars was acknowledged. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">&ldquo;Theirs was the giant race before the flood.&rdquo; </span>

    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      Since the return of the Royal house, much art and ability had been
      exerted, but the old masters had been still unrivalled. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">&ldquo;Our builders were with want of genius curst, <br /><span

      At length a writer had arisen who, just emerging from boyhood, had
      surpassed the authors of the Knight of the Burning Pestle and of the
      Silent Woman, and who had only one rival left to contend with. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">&ldquo;Heaven that but once was prodigal before, <br /><span

      more."= <span class="pagenum">391</span><a name="link391" id="link391"></a>Some
      lines near the end of the poem are singularly grave and touching, and sank
      deep into the heart of Congreve. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;Already
      am I worn with cares and age, <br /><span class="indent20">And just
      abandoning the ungrateful stage; <br /><span class="indent20">But you, whom
      every muse and grace adorn <br /><span class="indent20">Whom I foresee to

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, as usual, gradually came over to the opinion of the men of
      note; and the Double Dealer was before long quite as much admired, though
      perhaps never so much liked, as the Old Bachelor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1695 appeared Love for Love, superior both in wit and in scenic effect
      to either of the preceding plays. It was performed at a new theatre which
      Betterton and some other actors, disgusted by the treatment which they had
      received in Drury-Lane, had just opened in a tennis-court near Lincoln&rsquo;s
      Inn. Scarcely any comedy within the memory of the oldest man had been
      equally successful. The actors were so elated that they gave Congreve a
      share in their theatre; and he promised in return to furnish them with a
      play every year, if his health would permit. Two years passed, however,
      before he produced the &ldquo;Mourning Bride,&rdquo; a play which, paltry as it is
      when compared, we do not say, with Lear or Macbeth, but with the best
      dramas of Massinger and Ford, stands very high among the tragedies of the
      age in which it was written. To find any thing so good we must go twelve
      years back to Venice Preserved, or six years forward to the Fair Penitent.
      The noble passage which Johnson, both in writing and in conversation,
      extolled above any other in the English drama, has suffered greatly in the
      public <span class="pagenum">392</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a>estimation
      from the extravagance of his praise. Had he contented himself with saying
      that it was finer than any thing in the tragedies of Dryden, Otway, Lee,
      Rowe, Southern, Hughes, and Addison than any thing, in short, that had
      been written for the stage since the days of Charles the First, he would
      not have been in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the Mourning Bride was even greater than that of Love for
      Love. Congreve was now allowed to be the first tragic as well as the first
      comic dramatist of his time; and all this at twenty-seven. We believe that
      no English writer except Lord Byron has, at so early an age, stood so high
      in the estimation of his contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time took place an event which deserves, in our opinion, a very
      different sort of notice from that which has been bestowed on it by Mr.
      Leigh Hunt. The nation had now nearly recovered from the demoralising
      effect of the Puritan austerity. The gloomy follies of the reign of the
      Saints were but faintly remembered. The evils produced by profaneness and
      debauchery were recent and glaring. The Court, since the Revolution, had
      ceased to patronise licentiousness. Mary was strictly pious; and the vices
      of the cold, stern, and silent William, were not obtruded on the public
      eye. Discountenanced by the government, and falling in the favour of the
      people, the profligacy of the Restoration still maintained its ground in
      some parts of society. Its strongholds were the places where men of wit
      and fashion congregated, and above all, the theatres. At this conjuncture
      arose a great reformer whom, widely as we differ from him in many
      important points, we can never mention without respect. <br /><span
      class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EREMY
      COLLIER <span class="pagenum">393</span><a name="link393" id="link393"></a>was
      a clergyman of the Church of England, bred at Cambridge. His talents and
      attainments were such as might have been expected to raise him to the
      highest honours of his profession. He had an extensive knowledge of books;
      yet he had mingled much with polite society, and is said not to have
      wanted either grace or vivacity in conversation. There were few branches
      of literature to which he had not paid some attention. But ecclesiastical
      antiquity was his favourite study. In religious opinions he belonged to
      that section of the Church of England which lies furtherest from Geneva
      and nearest to Rome. His notions touching Episcopal government, holy
      orders, the efficacy of the sacraments, the authority of the Fathers, the
      guilt of schism, the importance of vestments, ceremonies, and solemn days,
      differed little from those which are now held by Dr. Pusey and Mr. Newman.
      Towards the close of Fis life indeed, Collier took some steps which
      brought him still nearer to Popery, mixed water with the wine in the
      Eucharist, made the sign of the cross in confirmation, employed oil in the
      visitation of the sick, and offered up prayers for the dead. His politics
      were of a piece with his divinity. He was a Tory of the highest sort, such
      as in the cant of his age was called a Tantivy. Not even the persecution
      of the bishops and the spoliation of the universities could shake his
      steady loyalty. While the Convention was sitting, he wrote with vehemence
      in defence of the fugitive king, and was in consequence arrested. But his
      dauntless spirit was not to be so tamed. He refused to take the oaths,
      renounced all his preferments, and, in a succession of pamphlets written
      with much violence and with some ability, attempted to excite the nation
      against <span class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394" id="link394"></a>its
      new masters. In 1692 he was again arrested on suspicion of having been
      concerned in a treasonable plot. So unbending were his principles that his
      friends could hardly persuade him to let them hail him; and he afterwards
      expressed his remorse for having been induced thus to acknowledge, by
      implication, the authority of an usurping government. He was soon in
      trouble again. Sir John Friend and Sir William Parkins were tried and
      convicted of high treason for planning the murder of King William. Collier
      administered spiritual consolation to them, attended them to Tyburn, and,
      just before they were turned off, laid his hands on their heads, and by
      the authority which he derived from Christ, solemnly absolved them. This
      scene gave indescribable scandal. Tories joined with Whigs in blaming the
      conduct of the daring priest. Some acts, it was said, which fall under the
      definition of treason are such that a good man may, in troubled times, be
      led into them even by his virtues. It may be necessary for the protection
      of society to punish such a man. But even in punishing him we consider him
      as legally rather than morally guilty, and hope that his honest error,
      though it cannot be pardoned here, will not be counted to him for sin
      hereafter. But such was not the case of Collier&rsquo;s penitents. They were
      concerned in a plot for waylaying and butchering, in an hour of security,
      one who, whether he were or were not their king, was at all events their
      fellow-creature. Whether the Jacobite theory about the rights of
      governments and the duties of subjects were or were not well founded,
      assassination must always be considered as a great crime. It is condemned
      even by the maxims of worldly honour and morality. Much more must it be an
      object of abhorrence to the pure Spouse of Christ. The Church <span
      class="pagenum">395</span><a name="link395" id="link395"></a>cannot
      surely, without the saddest and most mournful forebodings, see one of her
      children who has been guilty of this great wickedness pass into eternity
      without any sign of repentance. That these traitors had given any sign of
      repentance was not alleged. It might be that they had privately declared
      their contrition; and, if so, the minister of religion might be justified
      in privately assuring them of the Divine forgiveness. But a public
      remission ought to have been preceded by a public atonement. The regret of
      these men, if expressed at all, had been expressed in secret. The hands of
      Collier had been laid on them in the presence of thousands. The inference
      which his enemies drew from his conduct was that he did not consider the
      conspiracy against the life of William as sinful. But this inference he
      very vehemently, and, we doubt not, very sincerely denied. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm raged. The bishops put forth a solemn censure of the absolution.
      The Attorney-General brought the matter before the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench.
      Collier had now made up his mind not to give bail for his appearance
      before any court which derived its authority from the usurper. He
      accordingly absconded and was outlawed. He survived these events about
      thirty years. The prosecution was not pressed; and he was soon suffered to
      resume his literary pursuits in quiet. At a later period, many attempts
      were made to shake his perverse integrity by offers of wealth and dignity,
      but in vain. When he died, towards the end of the reign of George the
      First, he was still under the ban of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not be suspected of regarding either the politics or the theology
      of Collier with partiality; but we believe him to have been as honest and
      courageous <span class="pagenum">396</span><a name="link396" id="link396"></a>a
      man as ever lived. We will go further, and say that, though passionate and
      often wrongheaded, he was a singularly fair controversialist, candid,
      generous, too high-spirited to take mean advantages even in the most
      exciting disputes, and pure from all taint of personal malevolence. It
      must also be admitted that his opinions on ecclesiastical and political
      affairs, though in themselves absurd and pernicious, eminently qualified
      him to be the reformer of our lighter literature. The libertinism of the
      press and of the stage was, as we have said, the effect of a reaction
      against the Puritan strictness. Profligacy was, like the oak leaf on the
      twenty-ninth of May, the badge of a cavalier and a high churchman: Decency
      was associated with conventicles and calves&rsquo; heads. Grave prelates were
      too much disposed to wink at the excesses of a body of zealous and able
      allies who covered Roundheads and Presbyterians with ridicule. If a Whig
      raised his voice against the impiety and licentiousness of the fashionable
      writers, his mouth was instantly stopped by the retort; You are one of
      those who groan at a light quotation from Scripture, and raise estates out
      of the plunder of the Church, who shudder at a <i>double entendre</i>, and
      chop off the heads of kings. A Baxter, a Burnet, even a Tillotson, would
      have done little to purify our literature. But when a man fanatical in the
      cause of episcopacy and actually under outlawry for his attachment to
      hereditary right, came forward as the champion of decency, the battle was
      already half won.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1698, Collier published his Short View of the Profaneness and
      Immorality of the English Stage, a book which threw the whole literary
      world into commotion, but which is now much less read than it deserves.
      The faults of the work, indeed, are neither few <span class="pagenum">397</span><a
      name="link397" id="link397"></a>nor small. The dissertations on the Greek
      and Latin drama do not at all help the argument, and, whatever may have
      been thought of them by the generation which fancied that Christ Church
      had refuted Bentley, are such as, in the present day, a scholar of very
      humble pretensions may venture to pronounce boyish, or rather babyish. The
      censures are not sufficiently discriminating. The authors whom Collier
      accused had been guilty of such gross sins against decency, that he was
      certain to weaken instead of strengthening his case, by introducing into
      his charge against them any matter about which there could be the smallest
      dispute. He was, however, so injudicious as to place among the outrageous
      offences which he justly arraigned, some things which are really quite
      innocent, and some slight instances of levity which, though not perhaps
      strictly correct, could easily be paralleled from the works of writers who
      had rendered great services to morality and religion. Thus he blames
      Congreve, the number and gravity of whose real transgressions made it
      quite unnecessary to tax him with any that were not real, for using the
      words &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; and &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; in a light sense; as if an archbishop
      might not say that a speech was inspired by claret, or that an alderman
      was a martyr to the gout. Sometimes, again, Collier does not sufficiently
      distinguish between the dramatist and the persons of the drama. Thus he
      blames Vanbrugh for putting into Lord Foppington&rsquo;s mouth some contemptuous
      expressions respecting the Church service; though it is obvious that
      Vanbrugh could not better express reverence than by making Lord Foppington
      express contempt. There is also throughout the Short View too strong a
      display of professional feeling. Collier is not content with claiming for
      his order an <span class="pagenum">398</span><a name="link398" id="link398"></a>immunity
      from indiscriminate scurrility; he will not allow that, in any case, any
      word or act of a divine can be a proper subject for ridicule. Nor does he
      confine this benefit of clergy to the ministers of the established Church.
      He extends the privilege to Catholic priests, and, what in him is more
      surprising, to Dissenting preachers. This, however, is a mere trifle.
      Imaums, Brahmins, priests of Jupiter, priests of Baal, are all to be held
      sacred. Dryden is blamed for making the Mufti in Don Sebastian talk
      nonsense. Lee is called to a severe account for his incivility to
      Tiresias. But the most curious passage is that in which Collier resents
      some uncivil reflections thrown by Cassandra, in Dryden&rsquo;s Cleomenes, on
      the calf Apis and his hierophants. The words &ldquo;grass-eating, foddered god,&rdquo;
       words which really are much in the style of several passages in the Old
      Testament, give as much offence to this Christian divine as they could
      have given to the priests of Memphis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when all deductions have been made, great merit must be allowed to
      this work. There is hardly any book of that time from which it would be
      possible to select specimens of writing so excellent and so various. To
      compare Collier with Pascal would indeed be absurd. Yet we hardly know
      where, except in the Provincial Letters, we can find mirth so harmoniously
      and becomingly blended with solemnity as in the Short View. In truth, all
      the modes of ridicule, from broad fun to polished and antithetical
      sarcasm, were at Collier&rsquo;s command. On the other hand, he was complete
      master of the rhetoric of honest indignation. We scarcely know any volume
      which contains so many bursts of that peculiar eloquence which comes from
      the heart and goes to the heart. <span class="pagenum">399</span><a
      name="link399" id="link399"></a>Indeed the spirit of the book is truly
      heroic. In order to fairly appreciate it, we must remember the situation
      in which the writer stood. He was under the frown of power. His name was
      already a mark for the invectives of one half of the writers of the age,
      when, in the cause of good taste, good sense, and good morals, he gave
      battle to the other half. Strong as his political prejudices were, he
      seems on this occasion to have entirely laid them aside. He has forgotten
      that he is a Jacobite, and remembers only that he is a citizen and a
      Christian. Some of his sharpest censures are directed against poetry which
      had been hailed with delight by the Tory party, and had inflicted a deep
      wound on the Whigs. It is inspiriting to see how gallantly the solitary
      outlaw advances to attack enemies, formidable separately, and, it might
      have been thought, irresistible when combined, distributes his swashing
      blows right and left among Wycherley, Congreve, and Vanbrugh, treads the
      wretched D&rsquo;Urfey down in the dirt beneath his feet, and strikes with all
      his strength full at the towering crest of Dryden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect produced by the Short View was immense. The nation was on the
      side of Collier. But it could not be doubted that, in the great host which
      he had defied, some champion would be found to lift the gauntlet. The
      general belief was that Dryden would take the field; and all the wits
      anticipated a sharp contest between two well-paired combatants. The great
      poet had been singled out in the most marked manner. It was well known
      that he was deeply hurt, that much smaller provocations had formerly
      roused him to violent resentment, and that there was no literary weapon,
      offensive or defensive, of which he was not master. But his conscience
      smote him; he <span class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400"
       id="link400"></a>stood abashed, like the fallen archangel at the rebuke of
      Zephon,&mdash; <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;And felt how awful
      goodness is, and saw <br /><span class="indent20">Virtue in her shape how
      lovely; saw and pined <br /><span class="indent20">His loss.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later period he mentioned the Short View in the preface to his
      Fables. He complained, with some asperity, of the harshness with which he
      had been treated, and urged some matters in mitigation. But, on the whole,
      he frankly acknowledged that he had been justly reproved. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;Mr. Collier be my enemy, let him triumph. If he be my friend, as I have
      given him no personal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of my
      repentance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been wise in Congreve to follow his master&rsquo;s example. He was
      precisely in that situation in which it is madness to attempt a
      vindication; for his guilt was so clear, that no address or eloquence
      could obtain an acquittal. On the other hand, there were in his case many
      extenuating circumstances which, if he had acknowledged his error and
      promised amendment, would have procured his pardon. The most rigid censor
      could not but make great allowances for the faults into which so young a
      man had been seduced by evil example, by the luxuriance of a vigorous
      fancy, and by the inebriating effect of popular applause. The esteem, as
      well as the admiration, of the public was still within his reach. He might
      easily have effaced all memory of his transgressions, and have shared with
      Addison the glory of showing that the most brilliant wit may be the ally
      of virtue. But, in any case, prudence should have restrained him from
      encountering Collier. The nonjuror was a man thoroughly fitted by nature,
      education, and habit, for polemical dispute. <span class="pagenum">401</span><a
      name="link401" id="link401"></a>Congreve&rsquo;s mind, though a mind of no
      common fertility and vigour, was of a different class. No man understood
      so well the art of polishing epigrams and repartees into the clearest
      effulgence, and setting them neatly in easy and familiar dialogue. In this
      sort of jewellery he attained to a mastery unprecedented and inimitable.
      But he was altogether rude in the art of controversy; and he had a cause
      to defend which scarcely any art could have rendered victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event was such as might have been foreseen. Congreve&rsquo;s answer was a
      complete failure. He was angry, obscure, and dull. Even the Green Room and
      Will&rsquo;s Coffee-House were compelled to acknowledge that in wit, as well as
      in argument, the parson had a decided advantage over the poet. Not only
      was Congreve unable to make any show of a case where he was in the wrong;
      but he succeeded in putting himself completely in the wrong where he was
      in the right. Collier had taxed him with profaneness for calling a
      clergyman Mr. Prig, and for introducing a coachman named Jehu, in allusion
      to the King of Israel, who was known at a distance by his furious driving.
      Had there been nothing worse in the Old Bachelor and Double Dealer,
      Congreve might pass for as pure a writer as Cowper himself, who, in poems
      revised by so austere a censor as John Newton, calls a fox-hunting squire
      Nimrod, and gives to a chaplain the disrespectful name of Smug. Congreve
      might with good effect have appealed to the public whether it might not be
      fairly presumed that, when such frivolous charges were made, there were no
      very serious charges to make. Instead of doing this, he pretended that he
      meant no allusion to the Bible by the name of Jehu, and no reflection by
      the name of Prig. Strange, that a man of <span class="pagenum">402</span><a
      name="link402" id="link402"></a>such parts should, in order to defend
      himself against imputations which nobody could regard as important, tell
      untruths which it was certain that nobody would believe!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the pleas which Congreve set up for himself and his brethren was
      that, though they might be guilty of a little levity here and there, they
      were careful to inculcate a moral, packed close into two or three lines,
      at the end of every play. Had the fact been as he stated it, the defence
      would be worth very little. For no man acquainted with human nature could
      think that a sententious couplet would undo all the mischief that five
      profligate acts had done. But it would have been wise in Congreve to have
      looked again at his own comedies before he used this argument. Collier did
      so; and found that the moral of the Old Bachelor, the grave apophthegm
      which is to be a set-off against all the libertinism of the piece is
      contained in the following triplet: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">&ldquo;What
      rugged ways attend the noon of life! <br /><span class="indent15">Our sun
      declines, and with what anxious strife, <br /><span class="indent15">What
      pain, we tug that galling load&mdash;a wife.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love for Love,&rdquo; says Collier, &ldquo;may have a somewhat better farewell, but
      it would do a man little service should he remember it to his dying day:&rdquo;
       <br /><br /><span class="indent20">&ldquo;The miracle to-day is, that we find
      <br /><span class="indent20">A lover true, not that a woman&rsquo;s kind.&rdquo;
       </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Collier&rsquo;s reply was severe and triumphant. One of his repartees we will
      quote, not as a favourable specimen of his manner, but because it was
      called forth by Congreve&rsquo;s characteristic affectation. The poet spoke of
      the Old Bachelor as a trifle to which he attached no value, and which had
      become public by a sort of accident. &ldquo;I wrote it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to amuse
      myself in a <span class="pagenum">403</span><a name="link403" id="link403"></a>slow
      recovery from a fit of sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What his disease was,&rdquo; replied Collier, &ldquo;I am not to inquire: but it must
      be a very ill one to be worse than the remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that Congreve gained by coming forward on this occasion was that he
      completely deprived himself of the excuse which he might with justice have
      pleaded for his early offences. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Collier, &ldquo;should the man
      laugh at the mischief of the boy, and make the disorders of his nonage his
      own, by an after approbation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Congreve was not Collier&rsquo;s only opponent. Vanbrugh, Dennis, and Settle
      took the field. And, from a passage in a contemporary satire, we are
      inclined to think that among the answers to the Short View was one
      written, or supposed to be written, by Wycherley. The victory remained
      with Collier. A great and rapid reform in almost all the departments of
      our lighter literature was the effect of his labours. A new race of wits
      and poets arose, who generally treated with reverence the great ties which
      bind society together, and whose very indecencies were decent when
      compared with those of the school which flourished during the last forty
      years of the seventeenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      This controversy probably prevented Congreve from fulfilling the
      engagements into which he had entered with the actors. It was not till
      1700 that he produced the Way of the World, the most deeply meditated and
      the most brilliantly written of all his works. It wants, perhaps, the
      constant movement, the effervescence of animal spirits, which we find in
      Love for Love. But the hysterical rants of Lady Wishfort, the meeting of
      Witwould, and his brother, the country knight&rsquo;s courtship and his
      subsequent revel, and, above all, the chase and surrender of Millamant,
      are superior to any thing <span class="pagenum">404</span><a name="link404"
       id="link404"></a>that is to be found in the whole range of English comedy
      from the civil war downwards. It is quite inexplicable to us that this
      play should have failed on the stage. Yet so it was; and the author,
      already sore with the wounds which Collier had inflicted, was galled past
      endurance by this new stroke. He resolved never again to expose himself to
      the rudeness of a tasteless audience, and took leave of the theatre
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived twenty-eight years longer, without adding to the high literary
      reputation which he had attained. He read much while he retained his
      eyesight, and now and then wrote a short essay, or put an idle tale into
      verse; but he appears never to have planned any considerable work. The
      miscellaneous pieces which he published in 1710 are of little value, and
      have long been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stock of fame which he had acquired by his comedies was sufficient,
      assisted by the graces of his manner and conversation, to secure for him a
      high place in the estimation of the world. During the winter, he lived
      among the most distinguished and agreeable people in London. His summers
      were passed at the splendid country-seats of ministers and peers. Literary
      envy and political faction, which in that age respected nothing else,
      respected his repose. He professed to be one of the party of which his
      patron Montagu, now Lord Halifax, was the head. But he had civil words and
      small good offices for men of every shade of opinion. And men of every
      shade of opinion spoke well of him in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      His means were for a long time scanty. The place which he had in
      possession barely enabled him to live with comfort. And, when the Tories
      came into power, some thought that he would lose even this moderate <span
      class="pagenum">405</span><a name="link405" id="link405"></a>provision.
      But Harley, who was by no means disposed to adopt the exterminating policy
      of the October club, and who, with all his faults of understanding and
      temper, bad a sincere kindness for men of genius, reassured the anxious
      poet by quoting very gracefully and happily the lines of Virgil, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">&ldquo;Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Nec tam aversus equos Tyria Sol jungit ab urbe.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The indulgence with which Congreve was treated by the Tories was not
      purchased by any concession on his part which could justly offend the
      Whigs. It was his rare good fortune to share the triumph of his friends
      without having shared their proscription. When the House of Hanover came
      to the throne, he partook largely of the prosperity of those with whom he
      was connected. The reversion to which he had been nominated twenty years
      before fell in. He was made secretary to the island of Jamaica; and his
      whole income amounted to twelve hundred a year, a fortune which, for a
      single man, was in that age not only easy but splendid. He continued,
      however, to practise the frugality which he had learned when he could
      scarce spare, as Swift tells us, a shilling to pay the chairmen who
      carried him to Lord Halifax&rsquo;s. Though he had nobody to save for, he laid
      up at least as much as he spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infirmities of age came early upon him. His habits had been
      intemperate; he suffered much from gout; and, when confined to his
      chamber, he had no longer the solace of literature. Blindness, the most
      cruel misfortune that can befall the lonely student, made his books
      useless to him. He was thrown on society for all his amusement; and in
      society his good breeding and vivacity made him always welcome. <span
      class="pagenum">406</span><a name="link406" id="link406"></a>By the rising
      men of letters he was considered not as a rival, but as a classic. He had
      left their arena; he never measured his strength with them; and he was
      always loud in applause of their exertions. They could, therefore,
      entertain no jealousy of him, and thought no more of detracting from his
      fame than of carping at the great men who had been lying a hundred years
      in Poets&rsquo; Corner. Even the inmates of Grub Street, even the heroes of the
      Dunciad, were for once just to living merit. There can be no stronger
      illustration of the estimation in which Congreve was held than the fact
      that the English Iliad, a work which appeared with more splendid auspices
      than any other in our language, was dedicated to him. There was not a duke
      in the kingdom who would not have been proud of such a compliment. Dr.
      Johnson expresses great admiration for the independence of spirit which
      Pope showed on this occasion. &ldquo;He passed over peers and statesmen to
      inscribe his Iliad to Congreve, with a magnanimity of which the praise had
      been complete, had his friend&rsquo;s virtue been equal to his wit. Why he was
      chosen for so great an honour, it is not now possible to know.&rdquo; It is
      certainly impossible to know; yet we think it is possible to guess. The
      translation of the Iliad had been zealously befriended by men of all
      political opinions. The poet, who, at an early age, should be raised to
      affluence by the emulous liberality of Whigs and Tories, could not with
      propriety inscribe to a chief of either party a work which had been
      munificently patronised by both. It was necessary to find some person who
      was at once eminent and neutral. It was therefore necessary to pass over
      peers and statesmen. Congreve had a high name in letters. He had a high
      name in aristocratic circles. He lived on terms of civility <span
      class="pagenum">407</span><a name="link407" id="link407"></a>with men of
      all parties. By a courtesy paid to him, neither the ministers nor the
      leaders of the opposition could be offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singular affectation which had from the first been characteristic of
      Congreve grew stronger and stronger as he advanced in life. At last it
      became disagreeable to him to hear his own comedies praised. Voltaire,
      whose soul was burned up by the raging desire for literary renown, was
      half puzzled and half disgusted by what he saw, during his visit to
      England, of this extraordinary whim. Congreve disclaimed the character of
      a poet, declared that his plays were trifles produced in an idle hour, and
      begged that Voltaire would consider him merely as a gentleman. &ldquo;If you had
      been merely a gentleman,&rdquo; said Voltaire, &ldquo;I should not have come to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Congreve was not a man of warm affections. Domestic ties he had none; and
      in the temporary connections which he formed with a succession of beauties
      from the green-room his heart does not appear to have been interested. Of
      all his attachments that to Mrs. Bracegirdle lasted the longest and was
      the most celebrated. This charming actress, who was, during many years,
      the idol of all London, whose face caused the fatal broil in which
      Mountfort fell, and for which Lord Mohun was tried by the Peers, and to
      whom the Earl of Scarsdale was said to have made honourable addresses, had
      conducted herself, in very trying circumstances, with extraordinary
      discretion. Congreve at length became her confidential friend. They
      constantly rode out together and dined together. Some people said that she
      was his mistress, and others that she would soon be his wife. He was at
      last drawn away from her by the influence of a wealthier and <span
      class="pagenum">408</span><a name="link408" id="link408"></a>haughtier
      beauty. Henrietta, daughter of the great Marlborough, and Countess of
      Godolphin, had, on her father&rsquo;s death, succeeded to his dukedom, and to
      the greater part of his immense property. Her husband was an insignificant
      man, of whom Lord Chesterfield said that he came to the House of Peers
      only to sleep, and that he might as well sleep on the right as on the left
      of the woolsack. Between the Duchess and Congreve sprang up a most
      eccentric friendship. He had a seat every day at her table, and assisted
      in the direction of her concerts. That malignant old beldame, the Dowager
      Duchess Sarah, who had quarrelled with her daughter as she had quarrelled
      with everybody else, affected to suspect that there was something wrong.
      But the world in general appears to have thought that a great lady might,
      without any imputation on her character, pay marked attention to a man of
      eminent genius who was near sixty years old, who was still older in
      appearance and in constitution, who was confined to his chair by gout, and
      who was unable to read from blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1728, Congreve was ordered to try the Bath waters. During
      his excursion he was overturned in his chariot, and received some severe
      internal injury from which he never recovered. He came back to London in a
      dangerous state, complained constantly of a pain in his side, and
      continued to sink, till in the following January he expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left ten thousand pounds, saved out of the emoluments of his lucrative
      places. Johnson says that this money ought to have gone to the Congreve
      family, which was then in great distress. Doctor Young and Mr. Leigh Hunt,
      two gentlemen who seldom agree with each other, but with whom, on this
      occasion, we are <span class="pagenum">409</span><a name="link409"
       id="link409"></a>happy to agree, think that it ought to have gone to Mrs.
      Bracegirdle. Congreve bequeathed two hundred pounds to Mrs. Bracegirdle,
      and an equal sum to a certain Mrs. Jellat; but the bulk of his
      accumulations went to the Duchess of Marlborough, in whose immense wealth
      such a legacy was as a drop in the bucket. It might have raised the fallen
      fortunes of a Staffordshire squire; it might have enabled a retired
      actress to enjoy every comfort, and, in her sense, every luxury: but it
      was hardly sufficient to defray the Duchess&rsquo;s establishment for three
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great lady buried her friend with a pomp seldom seen at the funerals
      of poets. The corpse lay in state under the ancient roof of the Jerusalem
      Chamber, and was interred in Westminster Abbey. The pall was borne by the
      Duke of Bridgewater, Lord Cobham, the Earl of Wilmington, who had been
      speaker, and was afterwards First Lord of the Treasury, and other men of
      high consideration. Her Grace laid out her friend&rsquo;s bequest in a superb
      diamond necklace, which she wore in honour of him, and, if report is to be
      believed, showed her regard in ways much more extraordinary. It is said
      that a statue of him in ivory, which moved by clockwork, was placed daily
      at her table, that she had a wax doll made in imitation of him, and that
      the feet of the doll were regularly blistered and anointed by the doctors,
      as poor Congreve&rsquo;s feet had been when he suffered from the gout. A
      monument was erected to the poet in Westminster Abbey, with an inscription
      written by the Duchess; and Lord Cobham honoured him with a cenotaph,
      which seems to us, though that is a bold word, the ugliest and most absurd
      of the buildings at Stowe. <span class="pagenum">410</span><a
      name="link410" id="link410"></a>We have said that Wycherley was a worse
      Congreve. There was, indeed, a remarkable analogy between the writings and
      lives of these two men. Both were gentlemen liberally educated. Both led
      town lives, and knew human nature only as it appears between Hyde Park and
      the Tower. Both were men of wit. Neither had much imagination. Both at an
      early age produced lively and profligate comedies. Both retired from the
      field while still in early manhood, and owed to their youthful
      achievements in literature whatever consideration they enjoyed in later
      life. Both, after they had ceased to write for the stage, published
      volumes of miscellanies which did little credit either to their talents or
      to their morals. Both, during their declining years, hung loose upon
      society; and both in their last moments, made eccentric and unjustifiable
      dispositions of their estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in every point Congreve maintained his superiority to Wycherley.
      Wycherley had wit; but the wit of Congreve far outshines that of every
      comic writer, except Sheridan, who has arisen within the last two
      centuries. Congreve had not, in a large measure, the poetical faculty; but
      compared with Wycherley he might be called a great poet. Wycherley had
      some knowledge of books; but Congreve was a man of real learning.
      Congreve&rsquo;s offences against decorum, though highly culpable, were not so
      gross as those of Wycherley; nor did Congreve, like Wycherley, exhibit to
      the world the deplorable spectacle of a licentious dotage. Congreve died
      in the enjoyment of high consideration; Wycherley forgotten or despised.
      Congreve&rsquo;s will was absurd and capricious; but Wycherley&rsquo;s last actions
      appear to have been prompted by obdurate malignity. <span class="pagenum">411</span><a
      name="link411" id="link411"></a>Here, at least for the present, we must
      stop. Vanbrugh and Farquhar are not men to be hastily dismissed, and we
      have not left ourselves space to do them justice.

      We shall say very little of the book which lies on our table. And yet it
      is a book which, even if it had been the work of a less distinguished man,
      or had appeared under circumstances less interesting, would have well
      repaid an attentive perusal. It is valuable, both as a record of
      principles and as a model of composition.

      We find in it all the great maxims which, during more than forty years,
      guided Lord Holland&rsquo;s public conduct, and the chief reasons on which those
      maxims rest, condensed into the smallest possible space, and set forth
      with admirable perspicuity, dignity, and precision. To his opinions on
      Foreign Policy we for the most part cordially assent; but, now and then we
      are inclined to

      them imprudently generous. We could not have signed the protest against
      the detention of Napoleon. The protest respecting the course which England
      pursued at the Congress of Verona, though it contains much that is
      excellent, contains also positions which, we are inclined to think, Lord
      Holland would, at a later period, have admitted to be unsound. But to all
      his doctrines on constitutional questions, we give our hearty approbation;
      and we firmly believe that no British government has ever deviated from
      that line of internal policy which he has traced, without detriment to the
      public.

      We will give, as a specimen of this little volume, a single passage, in
      which a chief article of the political creed of the Whigs is stated and
      explained, with singular clearness, force, and brevity. Our readers will
      remember that, in 1825, the Catholic Association raised the cry of
      emancipation with most formidable effect. The Tories acted after their
      kind. Instead of removing the grievance they tried to put down the
      agitation, and brought in a law, apparently sharp and stringent, but in
      truth utterly impotent, for restraining the right of petition. Lord
      Holland&rsquo;s Protest on that occasion is excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We are,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;well aware that the privileges of the people, the
      rights of free discussion, and the spirit and letter of our popular
      institutions, must render,&mdash;and they are intended to render,&mdash;the
      continuance of an extensive grievance, and of the dissatisfaction
      consequent thereupon, dangerous to the tranquillity of the country, and
      ultimately subversive of the authority of the state. Experience and theory
      alike forbid us to deny that effect of a free constitution; a sense of
      justice and a love of liberty equally deter us from lamenting it. But we
      have always been taught to look for the remedy of such disorders in the
      redress of the grievances which justify them, and in the removal of the
      dissatisfaction from which they flow&mdash;not in restraints on ancient
      privileges, <span class="pagenum">414</span><a name="link414" id="link414"></a>not
      in inroads on the right of public discussion, nor in violations of the
      principles of a free government. If, therefore, the legal method of
      seeking redress, which has been resorted to by persons labouring under
      grievous disabilities, be fraught with immediate or remote danger to the
      state, we draw from that circumstance a conclusion long since foretold by
      great authority&mdash;namely, that the British constitution, and large
      exclusions, cannot subsist together; that the constitution must destroy
      them, or they will destroy the constitution.</i>&rdquo;

      It was not, however, of this little book, valuable and interesting as it
      is, but of the author, that we meant to speak; and we will try to do so
      with calmness and impartiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to fully appreciate the character of Lord Holland, it is
      necessary to go far back into the history of his family; for he had
      inherited something more than a coronet and an estate. To the House of
      which he was the head belongs one distinction which we believe to be
      without a parallel in our annals. During more than a century, there has
      never been a time at which a Fox has not stood in a prominent station
      among public men. Scarcely had the chequered career of the first Lord
      Holland closed, when his son, Charles, rose to the head of the Opposition,
      and to the first rank among English debaters. And before Charles was borne
      to Westminster Abbey a third Fox had already become one of the most
      conspicuous politicians in the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible not to be struck by the strong family likeness which, in
      spite of diversities arising from education and position, appears in these
      three distinguished persons. In their faces and figures there was a
      resemblance, such as is common enough in novels, where one picture is good
      for ten generations, but such as in real life is seldom found. The ample
      person, the massy <span class="pagenum">415</span><a name="link415"
       id="link415"></a>and thoughtful forehead, the large eyebrows, the full
      cheek and lip, the expression, so singularly compounded of sense, humour,
      courage, openness, a strong will and a sweet temper, were common to all.
      But the features of the founder of the House, as the pencil of Reynolds
      and the chisel of Nollekens have handed them down to us, were disagreeably
      harsh and exaggerated. In his descendants, the aspect was preserved, but
      it was softened till it became, in the late lord, the most gracious and
      interesting countenance that was ever lighted up by the mingled lustre of
      intelligence and benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was with the faces of the men of this noble family, so was it also
      with their minds. Nature had done much for them all. She had moulded them
      all of that clay of which she is most sparing. To all she had given strong
      reason and sharp wit, a quick relish for every physical and intellectual
      enjoyment, constitutional intrepidity, and that frankness by which
      constitutional intrepidity is generally accompanied, spirits which nothing
      could depress, tempers easy, generous, and placable, and that genial
      courtesy which has its seat in the heart, and of which artificial
      politeness is only a faint and cold imitation. Such a disposition is the
      richest inheritance that ever was entailed on any family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But training and situation greatly modified the fine qualities which
      nature lavished with such profusion on three generations of the house of
      Fox. The first Lord Holland was a needy political adventurer. He entered
      public life at a time when the standard of integrity among statesmen was
      low. He started as the adherent of a minister who had indeed many titles
      to respect, who possessed eminent talents both for administration <span
      class="pagenum">416</span><a name="link416" id="link416"></a>and for
      debate, who understood the public interest well, and who meant fairly by
      the country, but who had seen so much perfidy and meanness that he had
      become sceptical as to the existence of probity. Weary of the cant of
      patriotism, Walpole had learned to talk a cant of a different kind.
      Disgusted by that sort of hypocrisy which is at least a homage to virtue,
      he was too much in the habit of practising the less respectable hypocrisy
      which ostentatiously displays, and sometimes even simulates vice. To
      Walpole Fox attached himself, politically and personally, with the ardour
      which belonged to his temperament. And it is not to be denied that in the
      school of Walpole he contracted faults which destroyed the value of his
      many great endowments. He raised himself, indeed, to the first
      consideration in the House of Commons; he became a consummate master of
      the art of debate; he attained honours and immense wealth; but the public
      esteem and confidence were withheld from him. His private friends, indeed,
      justly extolled his generosity and good nature. They maintained that in
      those parts of his conduct which they could least defend there was nothing
      sordid, and that, if he was misled, he was misled by amiable feelings, by
      a desire to serve his friends, and by anxious tenderness for his children.
      But by the nation he was regarded as a man of insatiable rapacity and
      desperate ambition; as a man ready to adopt, without scruple, the most
      immoral and the most unconstitutional manners; as a man perfectly fitted,
      by all his opinions and feelings, for the work of managing the Parliament
      by means of secret-service-money, and of keeping down the people with the
      bayonet. Many of his contemporaries had a morality quite as lax as his:
      but very few among them had his talents, and none had his hardihood and
      energy. <span class="pagenum">417</span><a name="link417" id="link417"></a>He
      could not, like Sandys and Doddington, find safety in contempt. He
      therefore became an object of such general aversion as no statesman since
      the fall of Strafford has incurred, of such general aversion as was
      probably never in any country incurred by a man of so kind and cordial a
      disposition. A weak mind would have sunk under such a load of
      unpopularity. But that resolute spirit seemed to derive new firmness from
      the public hatred. The only effect which reproaches appeared to produce on
      him, was to sour, in some degree, his naturally sweet temper. The last
      acts of his public life were marked, not only by that audacity which he
      had derived from nature, not only by that immorality which he had learned
      in the school of Walpole, but by a harshness which almost amounted to
      cruelty, and which had never been supposed to belong to his character. His
      severity increased the unpopularity from which it had sprung. The
      well-known lampoon of Gray may serve as a specimen of the feeling of the
      country. All the images are taken from shipwrecks, quicksands, and
      cormorants. Lord Holland is represented as complaining, that the cowardice
      of his accomplices had prevented him from putting down the free spirit of
      the city of London by sword and fire, and as pining for the time when
      birds of prey should make their nests in Westminster Abbey, and unclean
      beasts burrow in St. Paul&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few months after the death of this remarkable man, his second son
      Charles appeared at the head of the party opposed to the American War.
      Charles had inherited the bodily and mental constitution of his father,
      and had been much, far too much, under his father&rsquo;s influence. It was
      indeed impossible that a son of so affectionate and noble a nature should
      not have <span class="pagenum">418</span><a name="link418" id="link418"></a>been
      warmly attached to a parent who possessed many fine qualities, and who
      carried his indulgence and liberality towards his children even to a
      culpable extent. Charles saw that the person to whom he was bound by the
      strongest ties was, in the highest degree, odious to the nation; and the
      effect was what might have been expected from the strong passions and
      constitutional boldness of so high-spirited a youth. He cast in his lot
      with his father, and took, while still a boy, a deep part in the most
      unjustifiable and unpopular measures that had been adopted since the reign
      of James the Second. In the debates on the Middlesex Election, he
      distinguished himself, not only by his precocious powers of eloquence, but
      by the vehement and scornful manner in which he bade defiance to public
      opinion. He was at that time regarded as a man likely to be the most
      formidable champion of arbitrary government that had appeared since the
      Revolution, to be a Bute with far greater powers, a Mansfield with far
      greater courage. Happily his father&rsquo;s death liberated him early from the
      pernicious influence by which he had been misled. His mind expanded. His
      range of observation became wider. His genius broke through early
      prejudices. His natural benevolence and magnanimity had fail play. In a
      very short time he appeared in a situation worthy of his understanding and
      of his heart. From a family whose name was associated in the public mind
      with tyranny and corruption, from a party of which the theory and the
      practice were equally servile, from the midst of the Luttrells, the
      Dysons, the Barringtons, came forth the greatest parliamentary defender of
      civil and religious liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late Lord Holland succeeded to the talents and to the fine natural
      dispositions of his House. But his <span class="pagenum">419</span><a
      name="link419" id="link419"></a>situation was very different from that of
      the two eminent men of whom we have spoken. In some important respects it
      was better, and in some it was worse than theirs. He had one great
      advantage over them. He received a good political education. The first
      lord was educated by Sir Robert Walpole. Mr. Fox was educated by his
      father. The late lord was educated by Mr. Fox. The pernicious maxims early
      imbibed by the first Lord Holland, made his great talents useless, and
      worse than useless, to the state. The pernicious maxims early imbibed by
      Mr. Fox led him, at the commencement of his public life, into great faults
      which, though afterwards nobly expiated, were never forgotten. To the very
      end of his career, small men, when they had nothing else to say in defence
      of their own tyranny, bigotry, and imbecility, could always raise a cheer
      by some paltry taunt about the election of Colonel Luttrell, the
      imprisonment of the lord mayor, and other measures in which the great Whig
      leader had borne a part at the age of one or two and twenty. On Lord
      Holland no such slur could be thrown. Those who most dissent from his
      opinions must acknowledge that a public life more consistent is not to be
      found in our annals. Every part of it is in perfect harmony with every
      other part; and the whole is in perfect harmony with the great principles
      of toleration and civil freedom. This rare felicity is in a great measure
      to be attributed to the influence of Mr. Fox. Lord Holland, as was natural
      in a person of his talents and expectations, began at a very early age to
      take the keenest interest in politics; and Mr. Fox found the greatest
      pleasure in forming the mind of so hopeful a pupil. They corresponded
      largely on political subjects when the young lord was only sixteen; and
      their <span class="pagenum">420</span><a name="link420" id="link420"></a>friendship
      and mutual confidence continued to the day of that mournful separation at
      Chiswick. Under such training such a man as Lord Holland was in no danger
      of falling into those faults which threw a dark shade over the whole
      career of his grandfather, and from which the youth of his uncle was not
      wholly free.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the late Lord Holland, as compared with his grandfather
      and his uncle, laboured under one great disadvantage. They were members of
      the House of Commons. He became a Peer while still an infant. When he
      entered public life, the House of Lords was a very small and a very
      decorous assembly. The minority to which he belonged was scarcely able to
      muster five or six votes on the most important nights, when eighty or
      ninety lords were present. Debate had accordingly become a mere form, as
      it was in the Irish House of Peers before the Union. This was a great
      misfortune to a man like Lord Holland. It was not by occasionally
      addressing fifteen or twenty solemn and unfriendly auditors, that his
      grandfather and his uncle attained their unrivalled parliamentary skill.
      The former had learned his art in &ldquo;the great Walpolean battles,&rdquo; on nights
      when Onslow was in the chair seventeen hours without intermission, when
      the thick ranks on both sides kept unbroken order till long after the
      winter sun had risen upon them, when the blind were led out by the hand
      into the lobby and the paralytic laid down in their bed-clothes on the
      benches. The powers of Charles Fox were, from the first, exercised in
      conflicts not less exciting. The great talents of the late Lord Holland
      had no such advantage. This was the more unfortunate, because the peculiar
      species of eloquence which <span class="pagenum">421</span><a
      name="link421" id="link421"></a>belonged to him in common with his family
      required much practice to develope it. With strong sense, and the greatest
      readiness of wit, a certain tendency to hesitation was hereditary in the
      line of Fox. This hesitation arose, not from the poverty, but from the
      wealth of their vocabulary. They paused, not from the difficulty of
      finding one expression, but from the difficulty of choosing between
      several. It was only by slow degrees and constant exercise that the first
      Lord Holland and his son overcame the defect. Indeed neither of them
      overcame it completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In statement, the late Lord Holland was not successful; his chief
      excellence lay in reply. He had the quick eye of his house for the unsound
      parts of an argument, and a great felicity in exposing them. He was
      decidedly more distinguished in debate than any peer of his time who had
      not sat in the House of Commons. Nay, to find his equal among persons
      similarly situated, we must go back eighty years to Earl Granville. For
      Mansfield, Thurlow, Loughborough, Grey, Grenville, Brougham, Plunkett, and
      other eminent men, living and dead, whom we will not stop to enumerate,
      carried to the Upper House an eloquence formed and matured in the Lower.
      The opinion of the most discerning judges was that Lord Holland&rsquo;s
      oratorical performances, though sometimes most successful, afforded no
      fair measure of his oratorical powers, and that, in an assembly of which
      the debates were frequent and animated, he would have attained a very high
      order of excellence. It was, indeed, impossible to listen to his
      conversation without seeing that he was bom a debater. To him, as to his
      uncle, the exercise of the mind in discussion was a positive pleasure.
      With the greatest good nature and <span class="pagenum">422</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a>good breeding, he was the very opposite to
      an assenter. The word &ldquo;disputatious&rdquo; is generally used as a word of
      reproach; but we can express our meaning only by saying that Lord Holland
      was most courteously and pleasantly disputatious. In truth, his quickness
      in discovering and apprehending distinctions and analogies was such as a
      veteran judge might envy. The lawyers of the Duchy of Lancaster were
      astonished to find in an unprofessional man so strong a relish for the
      esoteric parts of their science, and complained that as soon as they had
      split a hair, Lord Holland proceeded to split the filaments into filaments
      still finer. In a mind less happily constituted, there might have been a
      risk that this turn for subtilty would have produced serious evil. But in
      the heart and understanding of Lord Holland there was ample security
      against all such danger. He was not a man to be the dupe of his own
      ingenuity. He put his logic to its proper use; and in him the dialectician
      was always subordinate to the statesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      His political life is written in the chronicles of his country. Perhaps,
      as we have already intimated, his opinions on two or three great questions
      of foreign policy were open to just objection. Yet even his errors, if he
      erred, were amiable and respectable. We are not sure that we do not love
      and admire him the more because he was now and then seduced from what we
      regard as a wise policy by sympathy with the oppressed, by generosity
      towards the fallen, by a philanthropy so enlarged that it took in all
      nations, by love of peace, a love which in him was second only to the love
      of freedom, and by the magnanimous credulity of a mind which was as
      incapable of suspecting as of devising mischief. <span class="pagenum">423</span><a
      name="link423" id="link423"></a>To his views on questions of domestic
      policy the voice of his countrymen does ample justice. They revere the
      memory of the man who was, during forty years, the constant protector of
      all oppressed races and persecuted sects, of the man whom neither the
      prejudices nor the interests belonging to his station could seduce from
      the path of right, of the noble, who in every great crisis cast in his lot
      with the commons, of the planter, who made manful war on the slave trade,
      of the landowner, whose whole heart was in the struggle against the
      corn-laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have hitherto touched almost exclusively on those parts of Lord
      Holland&rsquo;s character which were open to the observation of millions. How
      shall we express the feelings with which his memory is cherished by those
      who were honoured with his friendship? Or in what language shall we speak
      of that house, once celebrated for its rare attractions to the furthest
      ends of the civilised world, and now silent and desolate as the grave? To
      that house, a hundred and twenty years ago, a poet addressed those tender
      and graceful lines, which have now acquired a new meaning not less sad
      than that which they originally bore. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">&ldquo;Thou
      hill, whose brow the antique structures grace, <br /><span class="indent15">Reared
      by bold chiefs of Warwick&rsquo;s noble race, <br /><span class="indent15">Why,
      once so loved, whene&rsquo;er thy bower appears, <br /><span class="indent15">O&rsquo;er

    <p>
      Yet a few years, and the shades and structures may <span class="pagenum">424</span><a
      name="link424" id="link424"></a>follow their illustrious masters. The
      wonderful city which, ancient and gigantic as it is, still continues to
      grow as fast as a young town of logwood by a water-privilege in Michigan,
      may soon displace those turrets and gardens which are associated with so
      much that is interesting and noble, with the courtly magnificence of Rich,
      with the loves of Ormond, with the counsels of Cromwell, with the death of
      Addison. The time is coming when, perhaps, a few old men, the last
      survivors of our generation, will in vain seek, amidst new streets and
      squares, and railway stations, for the site of that dwelling which was in
      their youth the favourite resort of wits and beauties, of painters and
      poets, of scholars, philosophers, and statesmen. They will then remember,
      with strange tenderness, many objects once familiar to them, the avenue
      and the terrace, the busts and the paintings, the carving, the grotesque
      gilding, and the enigmatical mottoes. With peculiar fondness they will
      recall that venerable chamber, in which all the antique gravity of a
      college library was so singularly blended with all that female grace and
      wit could devise to embellish a drawing-room. They will recollect, not
      unmoved, those shelves loaded with the varied learning of many lands and
      many ages, and those portraits in which were preserved the features of the
      best and wisest Englishmen of two generations. They will recollect how
      many men who have guided the politics of Europe, who have moved great
      assemblies by reason and eloquence, who have put life into bronze and
      canvas, or who have left to posterity things so written that it shall not
      willingly let them die, were there mixed with all that was loveliest and
      gayest in the society of the most splendid of capitals. They will remember
      the peculiar character which belonged to that circle, in <span
      class="pagenum">425</span><a name="link425" id="link425"></a>which every
      talent and accomplishment, every art and science, had its place. They will
      remember how the last debate was discussed in one corner, and the last
      comedy of Scribe in another; while Wilkie gazed with modest admiration on
      Sir Joshua&rsquo;s Baretti; while Mackintosh turned over Thomas Aquinas to
      verify a quotation; while Talleyrand related his conversations with Barras
      at the Luxembourg, or his ride with Lannes over the field of Austerlitz.
      They will remember, above all, the grace, and the kindness, far more
      admirable than grace, with which the princely hospitality of that ancient
      mansion was dispensed. They will remember the venerable and benignant
      countenance and the cordial voice of him who bade them welcome. They will
      remember that temper which years of pain, of sickness, of lameness, of
      confinement, served only to make sweeter and sweeter, and that frank
      politeness, which at once relieved all the embarrassment of the youngest
      and most timid writer or artist, who found himself for the first time
      among Ambassadors and Earls. They will remember that constant flow of
      conversation, so natural, so animated, so various, so rich with
      observation and anecdote; that wit which never gave a wound; that
      exquisite mimicry which ennobled, instead of degrading; that goodness of
      heart which appeared in every look and accent, and gave additional value
      to every talent and acquirement. They will remember, too, that he whose
      name they hold in reverence was not less distinguished by the inflexible
      uprightness of his political conduct than by his loving disposition and
      his winning manners. They will remember that, in the last lines which he
      traced, he expressed his joy that he had done nothing unworthy of the
      friend of Fox and <span class="pagenum">426</span><a name="link426"
       id="link426"></a>Grey; and they will have reason to feel similar joy, if,
      in looking back on many troubled years, they cannot accuse themselves of
      having done any thing unworthy of men who were distinguished by the
      friendship of Lord Holland.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
